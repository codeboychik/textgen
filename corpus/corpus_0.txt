She saw a secret little clearing, and a secret little hot made of rustic poles. And she had never been here before! She realized it was the quiet place where the growing pheasants were reared; the keeper in his shirt‑sleeves was kneeling, hammering. The dog trotted forward with a short, sharp bark, and the keeper lifted his face suddenly and saw her. He had a startled look in his eyes.

He straightened himself and saluted, watching her in silence, as she came forward with weakening limbs. He resented the intrusion; he cherished his solitude as his only and last freedom in life.

"I wondered what the hammering was," she said, feeling weak and breathless, and a little afraid of him, as he looked so straight at her.

"Ah'm gettin' th' coops ready for th' young bods,'" he said, in broad vernacular.

She did not know what to say, and she felt weak.

"I should like to sit down a bit," she said.

"Come and sit 'ere i' th' 'ut," he said, going in front of her to the hut, pushing aside some timber and stuff, and drawing out a rustic chair, made of hazel sticks.

"Am Ah t' light yer a little fire?" he asked, with the curious naïveté of the dialect.

"Oh, don't bother," she replied.

But he looked at her hands; they were rather blue. So he quickly took some larch twigs to the little brick fire‑place in the corner, and in a moment the yellow flame was running up the chimney. He made a place by the brick hearth.

"Sit 'ere then a bit, and warm yer,'" he said.

A wet brown dog came running and did not bark, lifting a wet feather of a tail. The man followed in a wet black oilskin jacket, like a chauffeur, and face flushed a little. She felt him recoil in his quick walk, when he saw her. She stood up in the handbreadth of dryness under the rustic porch. He saluted without speaking, coming slowly near. She began to withdraw.

"I'm just going," she said.

"Was yer waitin' to get in?" he asked, looking at the hut, not at her.

"No, I only sat a few minutes in the shelter," she said, with quiet dignity.

He looked at her. She looked cold.

"Sir Clifford 'adn't got no other key then?" he asked.

"No, but it doesn't matter. I can sit perfectly dry under this porch. Good afternoon!" She hated the excess of vernacular in his speech.

He watched her closely, as she was moving away. Then he hitched up his jacket, and put his hand in his breeches pocket, taking out the key of the hut.

"'Appen yer'd better 'ave this key, an' Ah min fend for t' bods some other road."

She looked at him.

"What do you mean?" she asked.

"I mean as 'appen Ah can find anuther pleece as'll du for rearin' th' pheasants. If yer want ter be 'ere, yo'll non want me messin' abaht a' th' time."

She looked at him, getting his meaning through the fog of the dialect.

"Why don't you speak ordinary English?" she said coldly.

"Me! Ah thowt it wor ordinary."

She was silent for a few moments in anger.

"So if yer want t' key, yer'd better tacit. Or 'appen Ah'd better gi'e 't yer termorrer, an' clear all t' stuff aht fust. Would that du for yer?'"

She became more angry.

"I didn't want your key," she said. "I don't want you to clear anything out at all. I don't in the least want to turn you out of your hut, thank you! I only wanted to be able to sit here sometimes, like today. But I can sit perfectly well under the porch, so please say no more about it."

He looked at her again, with his wicked blue eyes.

"Why," he began, in the broad slow dialect. "Your Ladyship's as welcome as Christmas ter th' hut an' th' key an' iverythink as is. On'y this time O' th' year ther's bods ter set, an' Ah've got ter be potterin' abaht a good bit, seein' after 'em, an' a'. Winter time Ah ned 'ardly come nigh th' pleece. But what wi' spring, an' Sir Clifford wantin' ter start th' pheasants. . .An' your Ladyship'd non want me tinkerin' around an' about when she was 'ere, all the time."

She listened with a dim kind of amazement.

"Why should I mind your being here?" she asked.

He looked at her curiously.

"T'nuisance on me!" he said briefly, but significantly. She flushed. "Very well!" she said finally. "I won't trouble you. But I don't think I should have minded at all sitting and seeing you look after the birds. I should have liked it. But since you think it interferes with you, I won't disturb you, don't be afraid. You are Sir Clifford's keeper, not mine."

The phrase sounded queer, she didn't know why. But she let it pass.

"Nay, your Ladyship. It's your Ladyship's own 'ut. It's as your Ladyship likes an' pleases, every time. Yer can turn me off at a wik's notice. It wor only. . ."

"Only what?" she asked, baffled.

He pushed back his hat in an odd comic way.

"On'y as 'appen yo'd like the place ter yersen, when yer did come, an' not me messin' abaht.'"

"But why?" she said, angry. "Aren't you a civilized human being? Do you think I ought to be afraid of you? Why should I take any notice of you and your being here or not? Why is it important?"

He looked at her, all his face glimmering with wicked laughter.

"It's not, your Ladyship. Not in the very least," he said.

"Well, why then?" she asked.

"Shall I get your Ladyship another key then?"

"No thank you! I don't want it."

"Ah'll get it anyhow. We'd best 'ave two keys ter th' place."

"And I consider you are insolent," said Connie, with her colour up, panting a little.

"Nay, nay!" he said quickly. "Dunna yer say that! Nay, nay! I niver meant nuthink. Ah on'y thought as if yo' come 'ere, Ah s'd ave ter clear out, an' it'd mean a lot of work, settin' up somewheres else. But if your Ladyship isn't going ter take no notice O' me, then. . .it's Sir Clifford's 'ut, an' everythink is as your Ladyship likes, everythink is as your Ladyship likes an' pleases, barrin' yer take no notice O' me, doin' th' bits of jobs as Ah've got ter do."

Connie went away completely bewildered. She was not sure whether she had been insulted and mortally of fended, or not. Perhaps the man really only meant what he said; that he thought she would expect him to keep away. As if she would dream of it! And as if he could possibly be so important, he and his stupid presence.

Les utopies apparaissent comme bien plus réalisables qu'on ne le croyait autrefois. Et nous nous trouvons actuellement devant une question bien autrement angoissante: Comment éviter leur réalisation définitive?... Les utopies sont réalisables. La vie marche vers les utopies. Et peut-être un siècle nouveau commence-t-il, un siècle où les intellectuels et la classe cultivée rêveront aux moyens d'éviter les utopies et de retourner à une societé non utopique, moins 'parfaite' et plus libre.

BRAVE NEW WORLD


Chapter I

A squat grey building of only thirty-four stories. Over the main entrance the words, CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING CENTRE, and, in a shield, the World State's motto, COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY.

The enormous room on the ground-floor faced towards the north. Cold for all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the room itself, a harsh thin light glared through the windows, hungrily seeking some draped lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose-flesh, but finding only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness responded to wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands gloved with a pale corpse-coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain rich and living substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak after luscious streak in long recession down the work-tables.

'And this,' said the Director opening the door, 'is the Fertilizing Room.'

Bent over their instruments, three hundred Fertilizers were plunged, as the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning entered the room, in the scarcely breathing silence, the absent-minded, soliloquizing hum or whistle, of absorbed concentration. A troop of newly arrived students, very young, pink and callow, followed nervously, rather abjectly, at the Director's heels. Each of them carried a note-book, in which, whenever the great man spoke, he desperately scribbled. Straight from the horse's mouth. It was a rare privilege. The D.H.C. for Central London always made a point of personally conducting his new students round the various departments.

'Just to give you a general idea,' he would explain to them. For of course some sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do their work intelligently--though as little of one, if they were to be good and happy members of society, as possible. For particulars, as every one knows, make for virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not philosophers, but fret-sawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of society.

'To-morrow,' he would add, smiling at them with a slightly menacing geniality, 'you'll be settling down to serious work. You won't have time for generalities. Meanwhile...'

Meanwhile, it was a privilege. Straight from the horse's mouth into the note-book. The boys scribbled like mad.

Tall and rather thin but upright, the Director advanced into the room. He had a long chin and big, rather prominent teeth, just covered, when he was not talking, by his full, floridly curved lips. Old, young? Thirty? fifty? fifty-five? It was hard to say. And anyhow the question didn't arise; in this year of stability, A.F. 632, it didn't occur to you to ask it.

'I shall begin at the beginning,' said the D.H.C., and the more zealous students recorded his intention in their note-books: Begin at the beginning. 'These,' he waved his hand, 'are the incubators.' And opening an insulated door he showed them racks upon racks of numbered test-tubes. 'The week's supply of ova. Kept,' he explained, 'at blood heat; whereas the male gametes,' and here he opened another door, 'they have to be kept at thirty-five instead of thirty-seven. Full blood heat sterilizes.' Rams wrapped in thermogene beget no lambs.

Still leaning against the incubators he gave them, while the pencils scurried illegibly across the pages, a brief description of the modern fertilizing process; spoke first, of course, of its surgical introduction--'the operation undergone voluntarily for the good of Society, not to mention the fact that it carries a bonus amounting to six months' salary'; continued with some account of the technique for preserving the excised ovary alive and actively developing; passed on to a consideration of optimum temperature, salinity, viscosity; referred to the liquor in which the detached and ripened eggs were kept; and, leading his charges to the work tables, actually showed them how this liquor was drawn off from the test-tubes; how it was let out drop by drop on to the specially warmed slides of the microscopes; how the eggs which it contained were inspected for abnormalities, counted and transferred to a porous receptacle; how (and he now took them to watch the operation) this receptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon containing free-swimming spermatozoa--at a minimum concentration of one hundred thousand per cubic centimetre, he insisted; and how, after ten minutes, the container was lifted out of the liquor and its contents re-examined; how, if any of the eggs remained unfertilized, it was again immersed, and, if necessary, yet again; how the fertilized ova went back to the incubators; where the Alphas and Betas remained until definitely bottled; while the Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons were brought out again, after only thirty-six hours, to undergo Bokanovsky's Process.

'Bokanovsky's Process,' repeated the Director, and the students underlined the words in their little note-books.

One egg, one embryo, one adult--normality. But a bokanovskified egg will bud, will proliferate, will divide. From eight to ninety-six buds, and every bud will grow into a perfectly formed embryo, and every embryo into a full-sized adult. Making ninety-six human beings grow where only one grew before. Progress.

'Essentially,' the D.H.C. concluded, 'bokanovskification consists of a series of arrests of development. We check the normal growth and, paradoxically enough, the egg responds by budding.'

Responds by budding. The pencils were busy.

He pointed. On a very slowly moving band a rack-full of test-tubes was entering a large metal box, another rack-full was emerging. Machinery faintly purred. It took eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he told them. Eight minutes of hard X-rays being about as much as an egg can stand. A few died; of the rest, the least susceptible divided into two; most put out four buds; some eight; all were returned to the incubators, where the buds began to develop; then, after two days, were suddenly chilled, chilled and checked. Two, four, eight, the buds in their turn budded; and having budded were dosed almost to death with alcohol; consequently burgeoned again and having budded--bud out of bud out of bud were thereafter--further arrest being generally fatal--left to develop in peace. By which time the original egg was in a fair way to becoming anything from eight to ninety-six embryos--a prodigious improvement, you will agree, on nature. Identical twins--but not in piddling twos and threes as in the old viviparous days, when an egg would sometimes accidentally divide; actually by dozens, by scores at a time.

'Scores,' the Director repeated and flung out his arms, as though he were distributing largesse. 'Scores.'

But one of the students was fool enough to ask where the advantage lay.

'My good boy!' The Director wheeled sharply round on him. 'Can't you see? Can't you see?' He raised a hand; his expression was solemn. 'Bokanovsky's Process is one of the major instruments of social stability!'

Major instruments of social stability.

Standard men and women; in uniform batches. The whole of a small factory staffed with the products of a single bokanovskified egg.

'Ninety-six identical twins working ninety-six identical machines!' The voice was almost tremulous with enthusiasm. 'You really know where you are. For the first time in history.' He quoted the planetary motto. 'Community, Identity, Stability.' Grand words. 'If we could bokanovskify indefinitely the whole problem would be solved.'

Solved by standard Gammas, unvarying Deltas, uniform Epsilons. Millions of identical twins. The principle of mass production at last applied to biology.

'But, alas,' the Director shook his head, 'we can't bokanovskify indefinitely.'

Ninety-six seemed to be the limit; seventy-two a good average. From the same ovary and with gametes of the same male to manufacture as many batches of identical twins as possible--that was the best (sadly a second best) that they could do. And even that was difficult.

'For in nature it takes thirty years for two hundred eggs to reach maturity. But our business is to stabilize the population at this moment, here and now. Dribbling out twins over a quarter of a century--what would be the use of that?'

Obviously, no use at all. But Podsnap's Technique had immensely accelerated the process of ripening. They could make sure of at least a hundred and fifty mature eggs within two years. Fertilize and bokanovskify--in other words, multiply by seventy-two--and you get an average of nearly eleven thousand brothers and sisters in a hundred and fifty batches of identical twins, all within two years of the same age.

'And in exceptional cases we can make one ovary yield us over fifteen thousand adult individuals.'

Beckoning to a fair-haired, ruddy young man who happened to be passing at the moment, 'Mr. Foster,' he called. The ruddy young man approached. 'Can you tell us the record for a single ovary, Mr. Foster?'

'Sixteen thousand and twelve in this Centre,' Mr. Foster replied without hesitation. He spoke very quickly, had a vivacious blue eye, and took an evident pleasure in quoting figures. 'Sixteen thousand and twelve; in one hundred and eighty-nine batches of identicals. But of course they've done much better,' he rattled on, 'in some of the tropical Centres. Singapore has often produced over sixteen thousand five hundred; and Mombasa has actually touched the seventeen thousand mark. But then they have unfair advantages. You should see the way a negro ovary responds to pituitary! It's quite astonishing, when you're used to working with European material. Still,' he added, with a laugh (but the light of combat was in his eyes and the lift of his chin was challenging), 'still, we mean to beat them if we can. I'm working on a wonderful Delta-Minus ovary at this moment. Only just eighteen months old. Over twelve thousand seven hundred children already, either decanted or in embryo. And still going strong. We'll beat them yet.'

'That's the spirit I like!' cried the Director, and clapped Mr. Foster on the shoulder. 'Come along with us and give these boys the benefit of your expert knowledge.'

Mr. Foster smiled modestly. 'With pleasure.' They went.

In the Bottling Room all was harmonious bustle and ordered activity. Flaps of fresh sow's peritoneum ready cut to the proper size came shooting up in little lifts from the Organ Store in the sub-basement. Whizz and then, click! the lift-hatches flew open; the Bottle-Liner had only to reach out a hand, take the flap, insert, smooth-down, and before the lined bottle had had time to travel out of reach along the endless band, whizz, click! another flap of peritoneum had shot up from the depths, ready to be slipped into yet another bottle, the next of that slow interminable procession on the band.

Next to the Liners stood the Matriculators. The procession advanced; one by one the eggs were transferred from their test-tubes to the larger containers; deftly the peritoneal lining was slit, the morula dropped into place, the saline solution poured in... and already the bottle had passed, and it was the turn of the labellers. Heredity, date of fertilization, membership of Bokanovsky Group--details were transferred from test-tube to bottle. No longer anonymous, but named, identified, the procession marched slowly on; on through an opening in the wall, slowly on into the Social Predestination Room.

'Eighty-eight cubic metres of card-index,' said Mr. Foster with relish, as they entered.

'Containing all the relevant information,' added the Director.

'Brought up to date every morning.'

'And co-ordinated every afternoon.'

'On the basis of which they make their calculations.'

'So many individuals, of such and such quality,' said Mr. Foster.

'Distributed in such and such quantities.'

'The optimum Decanting Rate at any given moment.'

'Unforeseen wastages promptly made good.'

'Promptly,' repeated Mr. Foster. 'If you knew the amount of overtime I had to put in after the last Japanese earthquake!' He laughed good-humouredly and shook his head.

'The Predestinators send in their figures to the Fertilizers.'

'Who give them the embryos they ask for.'

'And the bottles come in here to be predestinated in detail.'

'After which they are sent down to the Embryo Store.'

'Where we now proceed ourselves.'

And opening a door Mr. Foster led the way down a staircase into the basement.

The temperature was still tropical. They descended into a thickening twilight. Two doors and a passage with a double turn ensured the cellar against any possible infiltration of the day.

'Embryos are like photograph film,' said Mr. Foster waggishly, as he pushed open the second door. 'They can only stand red light.'

And in effect the sultry darkness into which the students now followed him was visible and crimson, like the darkness of closed eyes on a summer's afternoon. The bulging flanks of row on receding row and tier above tier of bottles glinted with innumerable rubies, and among the rubies moved the dim red spectres of men and women with purple eyes and all the symptoms of lupus. The hum and rattle of machinery faintly stirred the air.

'Give them a few figures, Mr. Foster,' said the Director, who was tired of talking.

Mr. Foster was only too happy to give them a few figures.

Two hundred and twenty metres long, two hundred wide, ten high. He pointed upwards. Like chickens drinking, the students lifted their eyes towards the distant ceiling.

Three tiers of racks: ground-floor level, first gallery, second gallery.

The spidery steelwork of gallery above gallery faded away in all directions into the dark. Near them three red ghosts were busily unloading demi-johns from a moving staircase.

The escalator from the Social Predestination Room.

Each bottle could be placed on one of fifteen racks, each rack, though you couldn't see it, was a conveyor travelling at the rate of thirty-three and a third centimetres an hour. Two hundred and sixty-seven days at eight metres a day. Two thousand one hundred and thirty-six metres in all. One circuit of the cellar at ground level, one on the first gallery, half on the second, and on the two hundred and sixty-seventh morning, daylight in the Decanting Room. Independent existence--so called.

'But in the interval,' Mr. Foster concluded, 'we've managed to do a lot to them. Oh, a very great deal.' His laugh was knowing and triumphant.

'That's the spirit I like,' said the Director once more. 'Let's walk round. You tell them everything, Mr. Foster.'

Mr. Foster duly told them.

Told them of the growing embryo on its bed of peritoneum. Made them taste the rich blood surrogate on which it fed. Explained why it had to be stimulated with placentin and thyroxin. Told them of the corpus luteum extract. Showed them the jets through which at every twelfth metre from zero to 2040 it was automatically injected. Spoke of those gradually increasing doses of pituitary administered during the final ninety-six metres of their course. Described the artificial maternal circulation installed on every bottle at metres 112; showed them the reservoir of blood-surrogate, the centrifugal pump that kept the liquid moving over the placenta and drove it through the synthetic lung and waste-product filter. Referred to the embryo's troublesome tendency to anæmia, to the massive doses of hog's stomach extract and foetal foal's liver with which, in consequence, it had to be supplied.

Showed them the simple mechanism by means of which, during the last two metres out of every eight, all the embryos were simultaneously shaken into familiarity with movement. Hinted at the gravity of the so-called 'trauma of decanting,' and enumerated the precautions taken to minimize, by a suitable training of the bottled embryo, that dangerous shock. Told them of the tests for sex carried out in the neighbourhood of metre 200. Explained the system of labelling--a T for the males, a circle for the females and for those who were destined to become freemartins a question mark, black on a white ground.

'For of course,' said Mr. Foster, 'in the vast majority of cases, fertility is merely a nuisance. One fertile ovary in twelve hundred--that would really be quite sufficient for our purposes. But we want to have a good choice. And of course one must always leave an enormous margin of safety. So we allow as many as thirty per cent. of the female embryos to develop normally. The others get a dose of male sex-hormone every twenty-four metres for the rest of the course. Result: they're decanted as freemartins--structurally quite normal (except,' he had to admit, 'that they do have just the slightest tendency to grow beards), but sterile. Guaranteed sterile. Which brings us at last,' continued Mr. Foster, 'out of the realm of mere slavish imitation of nature into the much more interesting world of human invention.'

He rubbed his hands. For, of course, they didn't content themselves with merely hatching out embryos: any cow could do that.

'We also predestine and condition. We decant our babies as socialized human beings, as Alphas or Epsilons, as future sewage workers or future...' He was going to say 'future World Controllers,' but correcting himself, said 'future Directors of Hatcheries' instead.

The D.H.C. acknowledged the compliment with a smile.

They were passing metre 320 on rack eleven. A young Beta-Minus mechanic was busy with screw-driver and spanner on the blood-surrogate pump of a passing bottle. The hum of the electric motor deepened by fractions of a tone as he turned the nuts. Down, down... A final twist, a glance at the revolution-counter, and he was done. He moved two paces down the line and began the same process on the next pump.

'Reducing the number of revolutions per minute,' Mr. Foster explained. 'The surrogate goes round slower; therefore passes through the lung at longer intervals; therefore gives the embryo less oxygen. Nothing like oxygen-shortage for keeping an embryo below par.' Again he rubbed his hands.

'But why do you want to keep the embryo below par?' asked an ingenuous student.

'Ass!' said the Director, breaking a long silence. 'Hasn't it occurred to you that an Epsilon embryo must have an Epsilon environment as well as an Epsilon heredity?'

It evidently hadn't occurred to him. He was covered with confusion.

'The lower the caste,' said Mr. Foster, 'the shorter the oxygen.' The first organ affected was the brain. After that the skeleton. At seventy per cent. of normal oxygen you got dwarfs. At less than seventy, eyeless monsters.

'Who are no use at all,' concluded Mr. Foster.

Whereas (his voice became confidential and eager), if they could discover a technique for shortening the period of maturation what a triumph, what a benefaction to Society!

'Consider the horse.'

They considered it.

Mature at six; the elephant at ten. While at thirteen a man is not yet sexually mature; and is only full grown at twenty. Hence, of course, that fruit of delayed development, the human intelligence.

'But in Epsilons,' said Mr. Foster very justly, 'we don't need human intelligence.'

Didn't need and didn't get it. But though the Epsilon mind was mature at ten, the Epsilon body was not fit to work till eighteen. Long years of superfluous and wasted immaturity. If the physical development could be speeded up till it was as quick, say, as a cow's, what an enormous saving to the Community!

'Enormous!' murmured the students. Mr. Foster's enthusiasm was infectious.

He became rather technical; spoke of the abnormal endocrine co-ordination which made men grow so slowly; postulated a germinal mutation to account for it. Could the effects of this germinal mutation be undone? Could the individual Epsilon embryo be made to revert, by a suitable technique, to the normality of dogs and cows? That was the problem. And it was all but solved.

Pilkington, at Mombasa, had produced individuals who were sexually mature at four and full grown at six and a half. A scientific triumph. But socially useless. Six-year-old men and women were too stupid to do even Epsilon work. And the process was an all-or-nothing one; either you failed to modify at all, or else you modified the whole way. They were still trying to find the ideal compromise between adults of twenty and adults of six. So far without success. Mr. Foster sighed and shook his head.

Their wanderings through the crimson twilight had brought them to the neighbourhood of Metre 170 on Rack 9. From this point onwards Rack 9 was enclosed and the bottles performed the remainder of their journey in a kind of tunnel, interrupted here and there by openings two or three metres wide.

'Heat conditioning,' said Mr. Foster.

Hot tunnels alternated with cool tunnels. Coolness was wedded to discomfort in the form of hard X-rays. By the time they were decanted the embryos had a horror of cold. They were predestined to emigrate to the tropics, to be miners and acetate silk spinners and steel workers. Later on their minds would be made to endorse the judgment of their bodies. 'We condition them to thrive on heat,' concluded Mr. Foster. 'Our colleagues upstairs will teach them to love it.'

'And that,' put in the Director sententiously, 'that is the secret of happiness and virtue--liking what you've got to do. All conditioning aims at that: making people like their unescapable social destiny.'

In a gap between two tunnels, a nurse was delicately probing with a long fine syringe into the gelatinous contents of a passing bottle. The students and their guides stood watching her for a few moments in silence.

'Well, Lenina,' said Mr. Foster, when at last she withdrew the syringe and straightened herself up.

The girl turned with a start. One could see that, for all the lupus and the purple eyes, she was uncommonly pretty.

'Henry!' Her smile flashed redly at him--a row of coral teeth.

'Charming, charming,' murmured the Director and, giving her two or three little pats, received in exchange a rather deferential smile for himself.

'What are you giving them?' asked Mr. Foster, making his tone very professional.

'Oh, the usual typhoid and sleeping sickness.'

'Tropical workers start being inoculated at metre 150,' Mr. Foster explained to the students. 'The embryos still have gills. We immunize the fish against the future man's diseases.' Then, turning back to Lenina, 'Ten to five on the roof this afternoon,' he said, 'as usual.'

'Charming,' said the Director once more, and, with a final pat, moved away after the others.

On Rack 10 rows of next generation's chemical workers were being trained in the toleration of lead, caustic soda, tar, chlorine. The first of a batch of two hundred and fifty embryonic rocket-plane engineers was just passing the eleven hundredth metre mark on Rack 3. A special mechanism kept their containers in constant rotation. 'To improve their sense of balance,' Mr. Foster explained. 'Doing repairs on the outside of a rocket in mid air is a ticklish job. We slacken off the circulation when they're right way up, so that they're half starved, and double the flow of surrogate when they're upside down. They learn to associate topsy-turvydom with well-being; in fact, they're only truly happy when they're standing on their heads.'

'And now,' Mr. Foster went on, 'I'd like to show you some very interesting conditioning for Alpha-Plus Intellectuals. We have a big batch of them on Rack 5. First Gallery level,' he called to two boys who had started to go down to the ground floor.

'They're round about metre 900,' he explained. 'You can't really do any useful intellectual conditioning till the foetuses have lost their tails. Follow me.'

But the Director had looked at his watch. 'Ten to three,' he said. 'No time for the intellectual embryos, I'm afraid. We must go up to the Nurseries before the children have finished their afternoon sleep.'

Mr. Foster was disappointed. 'At least one glance at the Decanting Room,' he pleaded.

'Very well, then.' The Director smiled indulgently. 'Just one glance.'


Chapter II

Mr. Foster was left in the Decanting Room. The D.H.C. and his students stepped into the nearest lift and were carried up to the fifth floor.

INFANT NURSERIES. NEO-PAVLOVIAN CONDITIONING ROOMS, announced the notice board.

The Director opened a door. They were in a large bare room, very bright and sunny; for the whole of the southern wall was a single window. Half a dozen nurses, trousered and jacketed in the regulation white viscose-linen uniform, their hair aseptically hidden under white caps, were engaged in setting out bowls of roses in a long row across the floor. Big bowls, packed tight with blossom. Thousands of petals, ripe-blown and silkily smooth, like the cheeks of innumerable little cherubs, but of cherubs, in that bright light, not exclusively pink and Aryan, but also luminously Chinese, also Mexican, also apoplectic with too much blowing of celestial trumpets, also pale as death, pale with the posthumous whiteness of marble.

The nurses stiffened to attention as the D.H.C. came in.

'Set out the books,' he said curtly.

In silence the nurses obeyed his command. Between the rose bowls the books were duly set out--a row of nursery quartos opened invitingly each at some gaily coloured image of beast or fish or bird.

'Now bring in the children.'

They hurried out of the room and returned in a minute or two, each pushing a kind of tall dumb-waiter laden, on all its four wire-netted shelves, with eight-month-old babies, all exactly alike (a Bokanovsky Group, it was evident) and all (since their caste was Delta) dressed in khaki.

'Put them down on the floor.'

The infants were unloaded.

'Now turn them so that they can see the flowers and books.'

Turned, the babies at once fell silent, then began to crawl towards those clusters of sleek colours, those shapes so gay and brilliant on the white pages. As they approached, the sun came out of a momentary eclipse behind a cloud. The roses flamed up as though with a sudden passion from within; a new and profound significance seemed to suffuse the shining pages of the books. From the ranks of the crawling babies came little squeals of excitement, gurgles and twitterings of pleasure.

The Director rubbed his hands. 'Excellent!' he said. 'It might almost have been done on purpose.'

The swiftest crawlers were already at their goal. Small hands reached out uncertainly, touched, grasped, unpetaling the transfigured roses, crumpling the illuminated pages of the books. The Director waited until all were happily busy. Then, 'Watch carefully,' he said. And, lifting his hand, he gave the signal.

The Head Nurse, who was standing by a switchboard at the other end of the room, pressed down a little lever.

There was a violent explosion. Shriller and ever shriller, a siren shrieked. Alarm bells maddeningly sounded.

The children started, screamed; their faces were distorted with terror.

'And now,' the Director shouted (for the noise was deafening), 'now we proceed to rub in the lesson with a mild electric shock.'

He waved his hand again, and the Head Nurse pressed a second lever. The screaming of the babies suddenly changed its tone. There was something desperate, almost insane, about the sharp spasmodic yelps to which they now gave utterance. Their little bodies twitched and stiffened; their limbs moved jerkily as if to the tug of unseen wires.

'We can electrify that whole strip of floor,' bawled the Director in explanation. 'But that's enough,' he signalled to the nurse.

The explosions ceased, the bells stopped ringing, the shriek of the siren died down from tone to tone into silence. The stiffly twitching bodies relaxed, and what had become the sob and yelp of infant maniacs broadened out once more into a normal howl of ordinary terror.

'Offer them the flowers and the books again.'

The nurses obeyed; but at the approach of the roses, at the mere sight of those gaily-coloured images of pussy and cock-a-doodle-doo and baa-baa black sheep, the infants shrank away in horror; the volume of their howling suddenly increased.

'Observe,' said the Director triumphantly, 'observe.'

Books and loud noises, flowers and electric shocks--already in the infant mind these couples were compromisingly linked; and after two hundred repetitions of the same or a similar lesson would be wedded indissolubly. What man has joined, nature is powerless to put asunder.

'They'll grow up with what the psychologists used to call an "instinctive" hatred of books and flowers. Reflexes unalterably conditioned. They'll be safe from books and botany all their lives.' The Director turned to his nurses. 'Take them away again.'

Still yelling, the khaki babies were loaded on to their dumb-waiters and wheeled out, leaving behind them the smell of sour milk and a most welcome silence.

One of the students held up his hand; and though he could see quite well why you couldn't have lower-caste people wasting the Community's time over books, and that there was always the risk of their reading something which might undesirably de-condition one of their reflexes, yet... well, he couldn't understand about the flowers. Why go to the trouble of making it psychologically impossible for Deltas to like flowers?

Patiently the D.H.C. explained. If the children were made to scream at the sight of a rose, that was on grounds of high economic policy. Not so very long ago (a century or thereabouts), Gammas, Deltas, even Epsilons, had been conditioned to like flowers--flowers in particular and wild nature in general. The idea was to make them want to be going out into the country at every available opportunity, and so compel them to consume transport.

'And didn't they consume transport?' asked the student.

'Quite a lot,' the D.H.C. replied. 'But nothing else.'

Primroses and landscapes, he pointed out, have one grave defect: they are gratuitous. A love of nature keeps no factories busy. It was decided to abolish the love of nature, at any rate among the lower classes; to abolish the love of nature, but not the tendency to consume transport. For of course it was essential that they should keep on going to the country, even though they hated it. The problem was to find an economically sounder reason for consuming transport than a mere affection for primroses and landscapes. It was duly found.

'We condition the masses to hate the country,' concluded the Director. 'But simultaneously we condition them to love all country sports. At the same time, we see to it that all country sports shall entail the use of elaborate apparatus. So that they consume manufactured articles as well as transport. Hence those electric shocks.'

'I see,' said the student, and was silent, lost in admiration.

There was a silence; then, clearing his throat, 'Once upon a time,' the Director began, 'while Our Ford was still on earth, there was a little boy called Reuben Rabinovitch. Reuben was the child of Polish-speaking parents.' The Director interrupted himself. 'You know what Polish is, I suppose?'

'A dead language.'

'Like French and German,' added another student, officiously showing off his learning.

'And "parent?"?' questioned the D.H.C.

There was an uneasy silence. Several of the boys blushed. They had not yet learned to draw the significant but often very fine distinction between smut and pure science. One, at last, had the courage to raise a hand.

'Human beings used to be...' he hesitated; the blood rushed to his cheeks. 'Well, they used to be viviparous.'

'Quite right.' The Director nodded approvingly.

'And when the babies were decanted...'

'"Born",' came the correction.

'Well, then they were the parents--I mean, not the babies, of course; the other ones.' The poor boy was overwhelmed with confusion.

'In brief,' the Director summed up, 'the parents were the father and the mother.' The smut that was really science fell with a crash into the boys' eye-avoiding silence. 'Mother,' he repeated loudly rubbing in the science; and, leaning back in his chair, 'These,' he said gravely, 'are unpleasant facts; I know it. But, then, most historical facts are unpleasant.'

He returned to Little Reuben--to Little Reuben, in whose room, one evening, by an oversight, his father and mother (crash, crash!) happened to leave the radio turned on.

('For you must remember that in those days of gross viviparous reproduction, children were always brought up by their parents and not in State Conditioning Centres.')

While the child was asleep, a broadcast programme from London suddenly started to come through; and the next morning, to the astonishment of his crash and crash (the more daring of the boys ventured to grin at one another) Little Reuben woke up repeating word for word a long lecture by that curious old writer ('one of the very few whose works have been permitted to come down to us'), George Bernard Shaw, who was speaking, according to a well-authenticated tradition, about his own genius. To Little Reuben's wink and snigger, this lecture was, of course, perfectly incomprehensible and, imagining that their child had suddenly gone mad, they sent for a doctor. He, fortunately, understood English, recognized the discourse as that which Shaw had broadcasted the previous evening, realized the significance of what had happened, and sent a letter to the medical press about it.

'The principle of sleep-teaching, or hypnopædia, had been discovered.' The D.H.C. made an impressive pause.

The principle had been discovered; but many, many years were to elapse before that principle was usefully applied.

'The case of Little Reuben occurred only twenty-three years after Our Ford's first T-Model was put on the market.' (Here the Director made a sign of the T on his stomach and all the students reverently followed suit.) 'And yet...'

Furiously the students scribbled. 'Hypnopædia, first used officially in A.F. 214. Why not before? Two reason. (a)...'

'These early experimenters,' the D.H.C. was saying, 'were on the wrong track. They thought that hypnopædia could be made an instrument of intellectual education...'

(A small boy asleep on his right side, the right arm stuck out, the right hand hanging limp over the edge of the bed. Through a round grating in the side of a box a voice speaks softly.

'The Nile is the longest river in Africa and the second in length of all the rivers of the globe. Although falling short of the length of the Mississippi-Missouri, the Nile is at the head of all rivers as regards the length of its basin, which extends through 35 degrees of latitude...'

At breakfast the next morning, 'Tommy,' some one says, 'do you know which is the longest river in Africa?' A shaking of the head. 'But don't you remember something that begins: The Nile is the...'

'The-Nile-is-the-longest-river-in-Africa-and-the second-in-length-of-all-the-rivers-of-the-globe...' The words come rushing out. 'Although-falling-short-of...'

'Well now, which is the longest river in Africa?'

The eyes are blank. 'I don't know.'

'But the Nile, Tommy.'

'The-Nile-is-the-longest-river-in-Africa-and-second...'

'Then which river is the longest, Tommy?'

Tommy bursts into tears. 'I don't know,' he howls.)

That howl, the Director made it plain, discouraged the earliest investigators. The experiments were abandoned. No further attempt was made to teach children the length of the Nile in their sleep. Quite rightly. You can't learn a science unless you know what it's all about.

'Whereas, if they'd only started on moral education,' said the Director, leading the way towards the door. The students followed him, desperately scribbling as they walked and all the way up in the lift. 'Moral education, which ought never, in any circumstances, to be rational.'

'Silence, silence,' whispered a loud-speaker as they stepped out at the fourteenth floor, and 'Silence, silence,' the trumpet mouths indefatigably repeated at intervals down every corridor. The students and even the Director himself rose automatically to the tips of their toes. They were Alphas, of course; but even Alphas have been well conditioned. 'Silence, silence.' All the air of the fourteenth floor was sibilant with the categorical imperative.

Fifty yards of tiptoeing brought them to a door which the Director cautiously opened. They stepped over the threshold into the twilight of a shuttered dormitory. Eighty cots stood in a row against the wall. There was a sound of light regular breathing and a continuous murmur, as of very faint voices remotely whispering.

A nurse rose as they entered and came to attention before the Director.

'What's the lesson this afternoon?' he asked.

'We had Elementary Sex for the first forty minutes,' she answered. 'But now it's switched over to Elementary Class Consciousness.'

The Director walked slowly down the long line of cots. Rosy and relaxed with sleep, eighty little boys and girls lay softly breathing. There was a whisper under every pillow. The D.H.C. halted and, bending over one of the little beds, listened attentively.

'Elementary Class Consciousness, did you say? Let's have it repeated a little louder by the trumpet.'

At the end of the room a loud-speaker projected from the wall. The Director walked up to it and pressed a switch.

'...all wear green,' said a soft but very distinct voice, beginning in the middle of a sentence, 'and Delta Children wear khaki. Oh no, I don't want to play with Delta children. And Epsilons are still worse. They're too stupid to be able to read or write. Besides, they wear black, which is such a beastly colour. I'm so glad I'm a Beta.'

There was a pause; then the voice began again.

'Alpha children wear grey. They work much harder than we do, because they're so frightfully clever. I'm really awfully glad I'm a Beta, because I don't work so hard. And then we are much better than the Gammas and Deltas. Gammas are stupid. They all wear green, and Delta children wear khaki. Oh no, I don't want to play with Delta children. And Epsilons are still worse. They're too stupid to be able...'

The Director pushed back the switch. The voice was silent. Only its thin ghost continued to mutter from beneath the eighty pillows.

'They'll have that repeated forty or fifty times more before they wake; then again on Thursday, and again on Saturday. A hundred and twenty times three times a week for thirty months. After which they go on to a more advanced lesson.'

Roses and electric shocks, the khaki of Deltas and a whiff of asafoetida--wedded indissolubly before the child can speak. But wordless conditioning is crude and wholesale; cannot bring home the finer distinctions, cannot inculcate the more complex courses of behaviour. For that there must be words, but words without reason. In brief, hypnopædia.

'The greatest moralizing and socializing force of all time.'

The students took it down in their little books. Straight from the horse's mouth.

Once more the Director touched the switch.

'...so frightfully clever,' the soft, insinuating, indefatigable voice was saying. 'I'm really awfully glad I'm a Beta, because...'

Not so much like drops of water, though water, it is true, can wear holes in the hardest granite; rather, drops of liquid sealing-wax, drops that adhere, incrust, incorporate themselves with what they fall on, till finally the rock is all one scarlet blob.

'Till at last the child's mind is these suggestions, and the sum of the suggestions is the child's mind. And not the child's mind only. The adult's mind too--all his life long. The mind that judges and desires and decides--made up of these suggestions. But all these suggestions are our suggestions!' The Director almost shouted in his triumph. 'Suggestions from the State.' He banged the nearest table. 'It therefore follows...'

A noise made him turn round.

'Oh, Ford!' he said in another tone, 'I've gone and woken the children.'


Chapter III

Outside, in the garden, it was playtime. Naked in the warm June sunshine, six or seven hundred little boys and girls were running with shrill yells over the lawns, or playing ball games, or squatting silently in twos and threes among the flowering shrubs. The roses were in bloom, two nightingales soliloquized in the boskage, a cuckoo was just going out of tune among the lime trees. The air was drowsy with the murmur of bees and helicopters.

The Director and his students stood for a short time watching a game of Centrifugal Bumble-puppy. Twenty children were grouped in a circle round a chrome-steel tower. A ball thrown up so as to land on the platform at the top of the tower rolled down into the interior, fell on a rapidly revolving disk, was hurled through one or other of the numerous apertures pierced in the cylindrical casing, and had to be caught.

'Strange,' mused the Director, as they turned away, 'strange to think that even in Our Ford's day most games were played without more apparatus than a ball or two and a few sticks and perhaps a bit of netting. Imagine the folly of allowing people to play elaborate games which do nothing whatever to increase consumption. It's madness. Nowadays the Controllers won't approve of any new game unless it can be shown that it requires at least as much apparatus as the most complicated of existing games.' He interrupted himself.

'That's a charming little group,' he said, pointing.

In a little grassy bay between tall clumps of Mediterranean heather, two children, a little boy of about seven and a little girl who might have been a year older, were playing, very gravely and with all the focussed attention of scientists intent on a labour of discovery, a rudimentary sexual game.

'Charming, charming!' the D.H.C. repeated sentimentally.

'Charming,' the boys politely agreed. But their smile was rather patronizing. They had put aside similar childish amusements too recently to be able to watch them now without a touch of contempt. Charming? but it was just a pair of kids fooling about; that was all. Just kids.

'I always think,' the Director was continuing in the same rather maudlin tone, when he was interrupted by a loud boo-hooing.

From a neighbouring shrubbery emerged a nurse, leading by the hand a small boy, who howled as he went. An anxious-looking little girl trotted at her heels.

'What's the matter?' asked the Director.

The nurse shrugged her shoulders. 'Nothing much,' she answered. 'It's just that this little boy seems rather reluctant to join in the ordinary erotic play. I'd noticed it once or twice before. And now again to-day. He started yelling just now...'

'Honestly,' put in the anxious-looking little girl, 'I didn't mean to hurt him or anything. Honestly.'

'Of course you didn't, dear,' said the nurse reassuringly. 'And so,' she went on, turning back to the Director, 'I'm taking him in to see the Assistant Superintendent of Psychology. Just to see if anything's at all abnormal.'

'Quite right,' said the Director. 'Take him in. You stay here, little girl,' he added, as the nurse moved away with her still howling charge. 'What's your name?'

'Polly Trotsky.'

'And a very good name too,' said the Director. 'Run away now and see if you can find some other little boy to play with.'

The child scampered off into the bushes and was lost to sight.

'Exquisite little creature!' said the Director, looking after her. Then, turning to his students, 'What I'm going to tell you now,' he said, 'may sound incredible. But then, when you're not accustomed to history, most facts about the past do sound incredible.'

He let out the amazing truth. For a very long period before the time of Our Ford, and even for some generations afterwards, erotic play between children had been regarded as abnormal (there was a roar of laughter); and not only abnormal, actually immoral (no!): and had therefore been rigorously suppressed.

A look of astonished incredulity appeared on the faces of his listeners. Poor little kids not allowed to amuse themselves? They could not believe it.

'Even adolescents,' the D.H.C. was saying, 'even adolescents like yourselves...'

'Not possible!'

'Barring a little surreptitious auto-erotism and homosexuality--absolutely nothing.'

'Nothing?'

'In most cases, till they were over twenty years old.'

'Twenty years old?' echoed the students in a chorus of loud disbelief.

'Twenty,' the Director repeated. 'I told you that you'd find it incredible.'

'But what happened?' they asked. 'What were the results?'

'The results were terrible.' A deep resonant voice broke startlingly into the dialogue.

They looked round. On the fringe of the little group stood a stranger--a man of middle height, black-haired, with a hooked nose, full red lips, eyes very piercing and dark. 'Terrible,' he repeated.

The D.H.C. had at that moment sat down on one of the steel and rubber benches conveniently scattered through the gardens; but at the sight of the stranger, he sprang to his feet and darted forward, his hands outstretched, smiling with all his teeth, effusive.

'Controller! What an unexpected pleasure! Boys, what are you thinking of? This is the Controller; this is his fordship, Mustapha Mond.'

****
In the four thousand rooms of the Centre the four thousand electric clocks simultaneously struck four. Discarnate voices called from the trumpet mouths.

'Main Day-shift off duty. Second Day-shift take over. Main Day-shift off...'

In the lift, on their way up to the changing-rooms, Henry Foster and the Assistant Director of Predestination rather pointedly turned their backs on Bernard Marx from the Psychology Bureau: averted themselves from that unsavoury reputation.

The faint hum and rattle of machinery still stirred the crimson air in the Embryo-Store. Shifts might come and go, one lupus-coloured face give place to another; majestically and for ever the conveyors crept forward with their load of future men and women.

Lenina Crowne walked briskly towards the door.

****
His fordship Mustapha Mond! The eyes of the saluting students almost popped out of their heads. Mustapha Mond! The Resident Controller for Western Europe! One of the Ten World Controllers. One of the Ten... and he sat down on the bench with the D.H.C., he was going to stay, to stay, yes, and actually talk to them... straight from the horse's mouth. Straight from the mouth of Ford himself.

Two shrimp-brown children emerged from a neighbouring shrubbery, stared at them for a moment with large, astonished eyes, then returned to their amusements among the leaves.

'You all remember,' said the Controller, in his strong deep voice, 'you all remember, I suppose, that beautiful and inspired saying of Our Ford's: History is bunk. History,' he repeated slowly, 'is bunk.'

He waved his hand; and it was as though, with an invisible feather whisk, he had brushed away a little dust, and the dust was Harappa, was Ur of the Chaldees; some spider-webs, and they were Thebes and Babylon and Cnossos and Mycenae. Whisk, Whisk--and where was Odysseus, where was Job, where were Jupiter and Gotama and Jesus? Whisk--and those specks of antique dirt called Athens and Rome, Jerusalem and the Middle Kingdom--all were gone. Whisk--the place where Italy had been was empty. Whisk, the cathedrals; whisk, whisk, King Lear and the Thoughts of Pascal. Whisk, Passion: whisk, Requiem; whisk, Symphony; whisk...

****
'Going to the Feelies this evening, Henry?' enquired the Assistant Predestinator. 'I hear the new one at the Alhambra is first-rate. There's a love scene on a bearskin rug; they say it's marvellous. Every hair of the bear reproduced. The most amazing tactual effects.'

****
'That's why you're taught no history,' the Controller was saying. 'But now the time has come...'

The D.H.C. looked at him nervously. There were those strange rumours of old forbidden books hidden in a safe in the Controller's study. Bibles, poetry--Ford knew what.

Mustapha Mond intercepted his anxious glance and the corners of his red lips twitched ironically.

'It's all right, Director,' he said in a tone of faint derision, 'I won't corrupt them.'

The D.H.C. was overwhelmed with confusion.

****
Those who feel themselves despised do well to look despising. The smile on Bernard Marx's face was contemptuous. Every hair on the bear indeed!

'I shall make a point of going,' said Henry Foster.

****
Mustapha Mond leaned forward, shook a finger at them. 'Just try to realize it,' he said, and his voice sent a strange thrill quivering along their diaphragms. 'Try to realize what it was like to have a viviparous mother.'

That smutty word again. But none of them dreamed, this time, of smiling.

'Try to imagine what "living with one's family" meant.'

They tried; but obviously without the smallest success.

'And do you know what a "home" was?'

They shook their heads.

****
From her dim crimson cellar Lenina Crowne shot up seventeen stories, turned to the right as she stepped out of the lift, walked down a long corridor and, opening the door marked GIRLS' DRESSING-ROOM, plunged into a deafening chaos of arms and bosoms and underclothing. Torrents of hot water were splashing into or gurgling out of a hundred baths. Rumbling and hissing, eighty vibro-vacuum massage machines were simultaneously kneading and sucking the firm and sunburnt flesh of eighty superb female specimens. Every one was talking at the top of her voice. A Synthetic Music machine was warbling out a super-cornet solo.

'Hullo, Fanny,' said Lenina to the young woman who had the pegs and locker next to hers.

Fanny worked in the Bottling Room, and her surname was also Crowne. But as the two thousand million inhabitants of the planet had only ten thousand names between them, the coincidence was not particularly surprising.

Lenina pulled at her zippers--downwards on the jacket, downwards with a double-handed gesture at the two that held trousers, downwards again to loosen her undergarment. Still wearing her shoes and stockings, she walked off towards the bathrooms.

****
Home, home--a few small rooms, stiflingly over-inhabited by a man, by a periodically teeming woman, by a rabble of boys and girls of all ages. No air, no space; an understerilized prison; darkness, disease, and smells.

(The Controller's evocation was so vivid that one of the boys, more sensitive than the rest, turned pale at the mere description and was on the point of being sick.)

****
Lenina got out of the bath, towelled herself dry, took hold of a long flexible tube plugged into the wall, presented the nozzle to her breast, as though she meant to commit suicide, pressed down the trigger. A blast of warmed air dusted her with the finest talcum powder. Eight different scents and eau-de-Cologne were laid on in little taps over the wash-basin. She turned on the third from the left, dabbled herself with chypre and, carrying her shoes and stockings in her hand, went out to see if one of the vibro-vacuum machines were free.

****
And home was as squalid psychically as physically. Psychically, it was a rabbit hole, a midden, hot with the frictions of tightly packed life, reeking with emotion. What suffocating intimacies, what dangerous, insane, obscene relationships between the members of the family group! Maniacally, the mother brooded over her children (her children)... brooded over them like a cat over its kittens; but a cat that could talk, a cat that could say, 'My baby, my baby,' over and over again. 'My baby, and oh, oh, at my breast, the little hands, the hunger, and that unspeakable agonizing pleasure! Till at last my baby sleeps, my baby sleeps with a bubble of white milk at the corner of his mouth. My little baby sleeps...'

'Yes,' said Mustapha Mond, nodding his head, 'you may well shudder.'

****
'Who are you going out with to-night?' Lenina asked, returning from the vibro-vac like a pearl illuminated from within, pinkly glowing.

'Nobody.'

Lenina raised her eyebrows in astonishment.

'I've been feeling rather out of sorts lately,' Fanny explained. 'Dr. Wells advised me to have a Pregnancy Substitute.'

'But, my dear, you're only nineteen. The first Pregnancy Substitute isn't compulsory till twenty-one.'

'I know, dear. But some people are better if they begin earlier. Dr. Wells told me that brunettes with wide pelvises, like me, ought to have their first Pregnancy Substitute at seventeen. So I'm really two years late, not two years early.' She opened the door of her locker and pointed to the row of boxes and labelled phials on the upper shelf.

'SYRUP OF CORPUS LUTEUM.' Lenina read the names aloud. 'OVARIN, GUARANTEED FRESH: NOT TO BE USED AFTER AUGUST 1ST, A.F. 632. MAMMARY GLAND EXTRACT: TO BE TAKEN THREE TIMES DAILY, BEFORE MEALS, WITH A LITTLE WATER. PLACENTIN: 5CC TO BE INJECTED INTRAVENALLY EVERY THIRD DAY... Ugh!' Lenina shuddered. 'How I loathe intravenals, don't you?'

'Yes. But when they do one good...' Fanny was a particularly sensible girl.

****
Our Ford--or Our Freud, as, for some inscrutable reason, he chose to call himself whenever he spoke of psychological matters--Our Freud had been the first to reveal the appalling dangers of family life. The world was full of fathers--was therefore full of misery; full of mothers--therefore of every kind of perversion from sadism to chastity; full of brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts--full of madness and suicide.

'And yet, among the savages of Samoa, in certain islands off the coast of New Guinea...'

The tropical sunshine lay like warm honey on the naked bodies of children tumbling promiscuously among the hibiscus blossoms. Home was in any one of twenty palm-thatched houses. In the Trobriands conception was the work of ancestral ghosts; nobody had ever heard of a father.

'Extremes,' said the Controller, 'meet. For the good reason that they were made to meet.'

****
'Dr. Wells says that a three months' Pregnancy Substitute now will make all the difference to my health for the next three or four years.'

'Well, I hope he's right,' said Lenina. 'But, Fanny, do you really mean to say that for the next three months you're not supposed to...'

'Oh no, dear. Only for a week or two, that's all. I shall spend the evening at the Club playing Musical Bridge. I suppose you're going out?'

Lenina nodded.

'Who with?'

'Henry Foster.'

'Again?' Fanny's kind, rather moon-like face took on an incongruous expression of pained and disapproving astonishment. 'Do you mean to tell me you're still going out with Henry Foster?'

****
Mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters. But there were also husbands, wives, lovers. There were also monogamy and romance.

'Though you probably don't know what those are,' said Mustapha Mond.

They shook their heads.

Family, monogamy, romance. Everywhere exclusiveness, everywhere a focussing of interest, a narrow channelling of impulse and energy.

'But every one belongs to every one else,' he concluded, citing the hypnopædic proverb.

The students nodded, emphatically agreeing with a statement which upwards of sixty-two thousand repetitions in the dark had made them accept, not merely as true, but as axiomatic, self-evident, utterly indisputable.

****
'But after all,' Lenina was protesting, 'it's only about four months now since I've been having Henry.'

'Only four months! I like that. And what's more,' Fanny went on, pointing an accusing finger, 'there's been nobody else except Henry all that time. Has there?'

Lenina blushed scarlet; but her eyes, the tone of her voice remained defiant. 'No, there hasn't been any one else,' she answered almost truculently. 'And I jolly well don't see why there should have been.'

'Oh, she jolly well doesn't see why there should have been,' Fanny repeated, as though to an invisible listener behind Lenina's left shoulder. Then, with a sudden change of tone, 'But seriously,' she said, 'I really do think you ought to be careful. It's such horribly bad form to go on and on like this with one man. At forty, or thirty-five, it wouldn't be so bad. But at your age, Lenina! No, it really won't do. And you know how strongly the D.H.C. objects to anything intense or long-drawn. Four months of Henry Foster, without having another man--why, he'd be furious if he knew...'

****
'Think of water under pressure in a pipe.' They thought of it. 'I pierce it once,' said the Controller. 'What a jet!'

He pierced it twenty times. There were twenty piddling little fountains.

'My baby. My baby...!'

'Mother!' The madness is infectious.

'My love, my one and only, precious, precious...'

Mother, monogamy, romance. High spurts the fountain; fierce and foamy the wild jet. The urge has but a single outlet. My love, my baby. No wonder those poor pre-moderns were mad and wicked and miserable. Their world didn't allow them to take things easily, didn't allow them to be sane, virtuous, happy. What with mothers and lovers, what with the prohibitions they were not conditioned to obey, what with the temptations and the lonely remorses, what with all the diseases and the endless isolating pain, what with the uncertainties and the poverty--they were forced to feel strongly. And feeling strongly (and strongly, what was more, in solitude, in hopelessly individual isolation), how could they be stable?

****
'Of course there's no need to give him up. Have somebody else from time to time, that's all. He has other girls, doesn't he?'

Lenina admitted it.

'Of course he does. Trust Henry Foster to be the perfect gentleman--always correct. And then there's the Director to think of. You know what a stickler...'

Nodding, 'He patted me on the behind this afternoon,' said Lenina.

'There, you see!' Fanny was triumphant. 'That shows what he stands for. The strictest conventionality.'

****
'Stability,' said the Controller, 'stability. No civilization without social stability. No social stability without individual stability.' His voice was a trumpet. Listening, they felt larger, warmer.

The machine turns, turns and must keep on turning--for ever. It is death if it stands still. A thousand millions scrabbled the crust of the earth. The wheels began to turn. In a hundred and fifty years there were two thousand millions. Stop all the wheels. In a hundred and fifty weeks there are once more only a thousand millions; a thousand thousand thousand men and women have starved to death.

Wheels must turn steadily, but cannot turn untended. There must be men to tend them, men as steady as the wheels upon their axles, sane men, obedient men, stable in contentment.

Crying: My baby, my mother, my only, only love; groaning: My sin, my terrible God; screaming with pain, muttering with fever, bemoaning old age and poverty--how can they tend the wheels? And if they cannot tend the wheels... The corpses of a thousand thousand thousand men and women would be hard to bury or burn.

****
'And after all,' Fanny's tone was coaxing, 'it's not as though there were anything painful or disagreeable about having one or two men besides Henry. And seeing that, you ought to be a little more promiscuous....'

****
'Stability,' insisted the Controller, 'stability. The primal and the ultimate need. Stability. Hence all this.'

With a wave of his hand he indicated the gardens, the huge building of the Conditioning Centre, the naked children furtive in the undergrowth or running across the lawns.

****
Lenina shook her head. 'Somehow,' she mused, 'I hadn't been feeling very keen on promiscuity lately. There are times when one doesn't. Haven't you found that too, Fanny?'

Fanny nodded her sympathy and understanding. 'But one's got to make the effort,' she said sententiously, 'one's got to play the game. After all, every one belongs to every one else.'

'Yes, every one belongs to every one else.' Lenina repeated slowly and, sighing, was silent for a moment; then, taking Fanny's hand, gave it a little squeeze. 'You're quite right, Fanny. As usual. I'll make the effort.'

****
Impulse arrested spills over, and the flood is feeling, the flood is passion, the flood is even madness: it depends on the force of the current, the height and strength of the barrier. The unchecked stream flows smoothly down its appointed channels into a calm well-being. (The embryo is hungry; day in, day out, the blood-surrogate pump unceasingly turns its eight hundred revolutions a minute. The decanted infant howls; at once a nurse appears with a bottle of external secretion. Feeling lurks in that interval of time between desire and its consummation. Shorten that interval, break down all those old unnecessary barriers.)

'Fortunate boys!' said the Controller. 'No pains have been spared to make your lives emotionally easy--to preserve you, so far as that is possible, from having emotions at all.'

'Ford's in his flivver,' murmured the D.H.C. 'All's well with the world.'

****
'Lenina Crowne?' said Henry Foster, echoing the Assistant Predestinator's question as he zipped up his trousers. 'Oh, she's a splendid girl. Wonderfully pneumatic. I'm surprised you haven't had her.'

'I can't think how it is I haven't,' said the Assistant Predestinator. 'I certainly will. At the first opportunity.'

From his place on the opposite side of the changing-room aisle, Bernard Marx overheard what they were saying and turned pale.

****
'And to tell the truth,' said Lenina, 'I'm beginning to get just a tiny bit bored with nothing but Henry every day.' She pulled on her left stocking. 'Do you know Bernard Marx?' she asked in a tone whose excessive casualness was evidently forced.

Fanny looked startled. 'You don't mean to say...?'

'Why not? Bernard's an Alpha-Plus. Besides, he asked me to go to one of the Savage Reservations with him. I've always wanted to see a Savage Reservation.'

'But his reputation?'

'What do I care about his reputation?'

'They say he doesn't like Obstacle Golf.'

'They say, they say,' mocked Lenina.

'And then he spends most of his time by himself--alone.' There was horror in Fanny's voice.

'Well, he won't be alone when he's with me. And anyhow, why are people so beastly to him? I think he's rather sweet.' She smiled to herself; how absurdly shy he had been! Frightened almost--as though she were a World Controller and he a Gamma-Minus machine minder.

****
'Consider your own lives,' said Mustapha Mond. 'Has any of you ever encountered an insurmountable obstacle?'

The question was answered by a negative silence.

'Has any of you been compelled to live through a long time-interval between the consciousness of a desire and its fulfilment?'

'Well,' began one of the boys, and hesitated.

'Speak up,' said the D.H.C. 'Don't keep his fordship waiting.'

'I once had to wait nearly four weeks before a girl I wanted would let me have her.'

'And you felt a strong emotion in consequence?'

'Horrible!'

'Horrible; precisely,' said the Controller. 'Our ancestors were so stupid and short-sighted that when the first reformers came along and offered to deliver them from those horrible emotions, they wouldn't have anything to do with them.'

****
'Talking about her as though she were a bit of meat.' Bernard ground his teeth. 'Have her here, have her there. Like mutton. Degrading her to so much mutton. She said she'd think it over, she said she'd give me an answer this week. Oh, Ford, Ford, Ford.' He would have liked to go up to them and hit them in the face--hard, again and again.

'Yes, I really do advise you to try her,' Henry Foster was saying.

****
'Take Ectogenesis. Pfitzner and Kawaguchi had got the whole technique worked out. But would the Governments look at it? No. There was something called Christianity. Women were forced to go on being viviparous.'

****
'He's so ugly!' said Fanny.

'But I rather like his looks.'

'And then so small' Fanny made a grimace; smallness was so horribly and typically low-caste.

'I think that's rather sweet,' said Lenina. 'One feels one would like to pet him. You know. Like a cat.'

Fanny was shocked. 'They say somebody made a mistake when he was still in the bottle--thought he was a Gamma and put alcohol into his blood-surrogate. That's why he's so stunted.'

'What nonsense!' Lenina was indignant.

****
'Sleep teaching was actually prohibited in England. There was something called liberalism. Parliament, if you know what that was, passed a law against it. The records survive. Speeches about liberty of the subject. Liberty to be inefficient and miserable. Freedom to be a round peg in a square hole.'

****
'But, my dear chap, you're welcome, I assure you. You're welcome.' Henry Foster patted the Assistant Predestinator on the shoulder. 'Every one belongs to every one else, after all.'

One hundred repetitions three nights a week for four years, thought Bernard Marx, who was a specialist on hypnopædia. Sixty-two thousand four hundred repetitions make one truth. Idiots!

****
'Or the Caste System. Constantly proposed, constantly rejected. There was something called democracy. As though men were more than physico-chemically equal.'

****
'Well, all I can say is that I'm going to accept his invitation.'

****
Bernard hated them, hated them. But they were two, they were large, they were strong.

****
'The Nine Years' War began in A.F. 141.'

****
'Not even if it were true about the alcohol in his blood-surrogate.'

****
'Phosgene, chloropicrin, ethyl iodoacetate, diphenylcyanarsine, trichlormethyl chloroformate, dichlorethyl sulphide. Not to mention hydrocyanic acid.'

****
'Which I simply don't believe,' Lenina concluded.

****
'The noise of fourteen thousand aeroplanes advancing in open order. But in the Kurfürstendamm and the Eighth Arrondissement, the explosion of the anthrax bombs is hardly louder than the popping of a paper bag.'

****
'Because I do want to see a Savage Reservation.'

****
CH3C6H2(NO2)3+Hg(CNO)2=well, what? An enormous hole in the ground, a pile of masonry, some bits of flesh and mucus, a foot, with the boot still on it, flying through the air and landing, flop, in the middle of the geraniums--the scarlet ones; such a splendid show that summer!

****
'You're hopeless, Lenina, I give you up.'

****
'The Russian technique for infecting water supplies was particularly ingenious.'

****
Back turned to back, Fanny and Lenina continued their changing in silence.

****
'The Nine Years' War, the great Economic Collapse. There was a choice between World Control and destruction. Between stability and...'

****
'Fanny Crowne's a nice girl too,' said the Assistant Predestinator.

****
In the nurseries, the Elementary Class Consciousness lesson was over, the voices were adapting future demand to future industrial supply. 'I do love flying,' they whispered, 'I do love flying, I do love having new clothes, I do love...'

****
'Liberalism, of course, was dead of anthrax, but all the same you couldn't do things by force.'

****
'Not nearly so pneumatic as Lenina. Oh, not nearly.'

****
'But old clothes are beastly,' continued the untiring whisper. 'We always throw away old clothes. Ending is better than mending, ending is better than mending, ending is better...'

****
'Government's an affair of sitting, not hitting. You rule with the brains and the buttocks, never with the fists. For example, there was the conscription of consumption.'

****
'There, I'm ready,' said Lenina; but Fanny remained speechless and averted. 'Let's make peace, Fanny darling.'

****
'Every man, woman and child compelled to consume so much a year. In the interests of industry. The sole result...'

****
'Ending is better than mending. The more stitches, the less riches; the more stitches...'

****
'One of these days,' said Fanny, with dismal emphasis, 'you'll get into trouble.'

****
'Conscientious objection on an enormous scale. Anything not to consume. Back to nature.'

****
'I do love flying, I do love flying.'

****
'Back to culture. Yes, actually to culture. You can't consume much if you sit still and read books.'

****
'Do I look all right?' Lenina asked. Her jacket was made of bottle-green acetate cloth with green viscose fur at the cuffs and collar.

****
'Eight hundred Simple Lifers were mowed down by machine guns at Golders Green.'

****
'Ending is better than mending, ending is better than mending.'

****
Green corduroy shorts and white viscose-woollen stockings turned down below the knee.

****
'Then came the famous British Museum Massacre. Two thousand culture fans gassed with dichlorethyl sulphide.'

****
A green-and-white jockey cap shaded Lenina's eyes; her shoes were bright green and highly polished.

****
'In the end,' said Mustapha Mond, 'the Controllers realized that force was no good. The slower but infinitely surer methods of ectogenesis, Neo-Pavlovian conditioning and hypnopædia...'

****
And round her waist she wore a silver-mounted green morocco-surrogate cartridge belt, bulging (for Lenina was not a freemartin) with the regulation supply of contraceptives.

****
'The discoveries of Pfitzner and Kawaguchi were at last made use of. An intensive propaganda against viviparous reproduction...'

****
'Perfect!' cried Fanny enthusiastically. She could never resist Lenina's charm for long. 'And what a perfectly sweet Malthusian belt!'

****
'Accompanied by a campaign against the Past; by the closing of museums, the blowing up of historical monuments (luckily most of them had already been destroyed during the Nine Years' War); by the suppression of all books published before A.F. 150.'

****
'I simply must get one like it,' said Fanny.

****
'There were some things called the pyramids, for example.'

****
'My old black-patent bandolier...'

****
'And a man called Shakespeare. You've never heard of them of course.'

****
'It's an absolute disgrace--that bandolier of mine.'

****
'Such are the advantages of a really scientific education.'

****
'The more stitches the less riches; the more stitches the less...'

****
'The introduction of Our Ford's first T-Model...'

****
'I've had it nearly three months.'

****
'Chosen as the opening date of the new era.'

****
'Ending is better than mending; ending is better...'

****
'There was a thing, as I've said before, called Christianity.'

****
'Ending is better than mending.'

****
'The ethics and philosophy of under-consumption...'

****
'I love new clothes, I love new clothes, I love...'

****
'So essential when there was under-production; but in an age of machines and the fixation of nitrogen--positively a crime against society.'

****
'Henry Foster gave it me.'

****
'All crosses had their tops cut and became T's. There was also a thing called God.'

****
'It's real morocco-surrogate.'

****
'We have the World State now. And Ford's Day celebrations, and Community Sings, and Solidarity Services.'

****
'Ford, how I hate them!' Bernard Marx was thinking.

****
'There was a thing called Heaven; but all the same they used to drink enormous quantities of alcohol.'

****
'Like meat, like so much meat.'

****
'There was a thing called the soul and a thing called immortality.'

****
'Do ask Henry where he got it.'

****
'But they used to take morphia and cocaine.'

****
'And what makes it worse, she thinks of herself as meat.'

****
'Two thousand pharmacologists and bio-chemists were subsidized in A.F. 178.'

****
'He does look glum,' said the Assistant Predestinator, pointing at Bernard Marx.

****
'Six years later it was being produced commercially. The perfect drug.'

****
'Let's bait him.'

****
'Euphoric, narcotic, pleasantly hallucinant.'

****
'Glum, Marx, glum.' The clap on the shoulder made him start, look up. It was that brute Henry Foster. 'What you need is a gramme of soma.'

****
'All the advantages of Christianity and alcohol; none of their defects.'

****
'Ford, I should like to kill him!' But all he did was to say, 'No, thank you,' and fend off the proffered tube of tablets.

****
'Take a holiday from reality whenever you like, and come back without so much as a headache or a mythology.'

****
'Take it,' insisted Henry Foster, 'take it.'

****
'Stability was practically assured.'

****
'One cubic centimetre cures ten gloomy sentiments,' said the Assistant Predestinator, citing a piece of homely hypnopædic wisdom.

****
'It only remained to conquer old age.'

****
'Damn you, damn you!' shouted Bernard Marx.

****
'Hoity-toity.'

****
'Gonadal hormones, transfusion of young blood, magnesium salts...'

****
'And do remember that a gramme is better than a damn.' They went out, laughing.

****
'All the physiological stigmata of old age have been abolished. And along with them, of course...'

****
'Don't forget to ask him about that Malthusian belt,' said Fanny.

****
'Along with them all the old man's mental peculiarities. Characters remain constant throughout a whole lifetime.'

****
'...two rounds of Obstacle Golf to get through before dark. I must fly.'

****
'Work, play--at sixty our powers and tastes are what they were at seventeen. Old men in the bad old days used to renounce, retire, take to religion, spend their time reading, thinking--thinking!'

****
'Idiots, swine!' Bernard Marx was saying to himself, as he walked down the corridor to the lift.

****
'Now--such is progress--the old men work, the old men copulate, the old men have no time, no leisure from pleasure, not a moment to sit down and think--or if ever by some unlucky chance such a crevice of time should yawn in the solid substance of their distractions, there is always soma, delicious soma, half a gramme for a half-holiday, a gramme for a week-end, two grammes for a trip to the gorgeous East, three for a dark eternity on the moon; returning whence they find themselves on the other side of the crevice, safe on the solid ground of daily labour and distraction, scampering from feely to feely, from girl to pneumatic girl, from Electro-magnetic Golf Course to...'

****
'Go away, little girl,' shouted the D.H.C. angrily. 'Go away, little boy! Can't you see that his fordship's busy? Go and do your erotic play somewhere else.'

****
'Poor little children!' said the Controller.

****
Slowly, majestically, with a faint humming of machinery, the Conveyors moved forward, thirty-three centimetres an hour. In the red darkness glinted innumerable rubies.


Chapter IV

§ 1
The lift was crowded with men from the Alpha Changing Rooms, and Lenina's entry was greeted by many friendly nods and smiles. She was a popular girl and, at one time or another, had spent a night with almost all of them.

They were dear boys, she thought, as she returned their salutations. Charming boys! Still, she did wish that George Edzel's ears weren't quite so big (perhaps he'd been given just a spot too much parathyroid at metre 328?). And looking at Benito Hoover, she couldn't help remembering that he was really too hairy when he took his clothes off.

Turning, with eyes a little saddened by the recollection of Benito's curly blackness, she saw in a corner the small thin body, the melancholy face of Bernard Marx.

'Bernard!' she stepped up to him. 'I was looking for you.' Her voice rang clear above the hum of the mounting lift. The others looked round curiously. 'I wanted to talk to you about our New Mexico plan.' Out of the tail of her eye she could see Benito Hoover gaping with astonishment. The gape annoyed her. 'Surprised I shouldn't be begging to go with him again!' she said to herself. Then aloud, and more warmly than ever, 'I'd simply love to come with you for a week in July,' she went on. (Anyhow, she was publicly proving her unfaithfulness to Henry. Fanny ought to be pleased, even though it was Bernard.) 'That is,' Lenina gave him her most deliciously significant smile, 'if you still want to have me.'

Bernard's pale face flushed. 'What on earth for?' she wondered, astonished, but at the same time touched by this strange tribute to her power.

'Hadn't we better talk about it somewhere else?' he stammered, looking horribly uncomfortable.

'As though I'd been saying something shocking,' thought Lenina. 'He couldn't look more upset if I'd made a dirty joke--asked him who his mother was, or something like that.'

'I mean, with all these people about...' He was choked with confusion.

Lenina's laugh was frank and wholly unmalicious. 'How funny you are!' she said; and she quite genuinely did think him funny. 'You'll give me at least a week's warning, won't you,' she went on in another tone. 'I suppose we take the Blue Pacific Rocket? Does it start from the Charing-T Tower? Or is it from Hampstead?'

Before Bernard could answer, the lift came to a standstill.

'Roof!' called a creaking voice.

The liftman was a small simian creature, dressed in the black tunic of an Epsilon-Minus Semi-Moron.

'Roof!'

He flung open the gates. The warm glory of afternoon sunlight made him start and blink his eyes. 'Oh, roof!' he repeated in a voice of rapture. He was as though suddenly and joyfully awakened from a dark annihilating stupor. 'Roof!'

He smiled up with a kind of doggily expectant adoration into the faces of his passengers. Talking and laughing together, they stepped out into the light. The liftman looked after them.

'Roof?' he said once more, questioningly.

Then a bell rang, and from the ceiling of the lift a loud-speaker began, very softly and yet very imperiously, to issue its commands.

'Go down,' it said, 'go down. Floor Eighteen. Go down, go down. Floor Eighteen. Go down, go...'

The liftman slammed the gates, touched a button and instantly dropped back into the droning twilight of the well, the twilight of his own habitual stupor.

It was warm and bright on the roof. The summer afternoon was drowsy with the hum of passing helicopters; and the deeper drone of the rocket-planes hastening, invisible, through the bright sky five or six miles overhead was like a caress on the soft air. Bernard Marx drew a deep breath. He looked up into the sky and round the blue horizon and finally down into Lenina's face.

'Isn't it beautiful!' His voice trembled a little.

She smiled at him with an expression of the most sympathetic understanding. 'Simply perfect for Obstacle Golf,' she answered rapturously. 'And now I must fly, Bernard. Henry gets cross if I keep him waiting. Let me know in good time about the date.' And waving her hand, she ran away across the wide flat roof towards the hangars. Bernard stood watching the retreating twinkle of the white stockings, the sunburnt knees vivaciously bending and unbending, again, again, and the softer rolling of those well-fitted corduroy shorts beneath the bottle-green jacket. His face wore an expression of pain.

'I should say she was pretty,' said a loud and cheery voice just behind him.

Bernard started, and looked round. The chubby red face of Benito Hoover was beaming down at him--beaming with manifest cordiality. Benito was notoriously good-natured. People said of him that he could have got through life without ever touching soma. The malice and bad tempers from which other people had to take holidays never afflicted him. Reality for Benito was always sunny.

'Pneumatic too. And how!' Then, in another tone, 'But, I say,' he went on, 'you do look glum! What you need is a gramme of soma.' Diving into his right-hand trouser-pocket, Benito produced a phial. 'One cubic centimetre cures ten gloomy... But, I say!'

Bernard had suddenly turned and rushed away.

Benito stared after him. 'What can be the matter with the fellow?' he wondered, and, shaking his head, decided that the story about the alcohol having been put into the poor chap's blood-surrogate must be true. 'Touched his brain, I suppose.'

He put away the soma bottle, and taking out a packet of sex-hormone chewing-gum, stuffed a plug into his cheek and walked slowly away towards the hangars, ruminating.

Henry Foster had had his machine wheeled out of its lock-up and, when Lenina arrived, was already seated in the cockpit, waiting.

'Four minutes late,' was all his comment, as she climbed in beside him. He started the engines and threw the helicopter screws into gear. The machine shot vertically into the air. Henry accelerated; the humming of the propeller shrilled from hornet to wasp, from wasp to mosquito; the speedometer showed that they were rising at the best part of two kilometres a minute. London diminished beneath them. The huge table-topped buildings were no more, in a few seconds, than a bed of geometrical mushrooms sprouting from the green of park and garden. In the midst of them, thin-stalked, a taller, slenderer fungus, the Charing-T Tower lifted towards the sky a disk of shining concrete.

Like the vague torsos of fabulous athletes, huge fleshy clouds lolled on the blue air above their heads. Out of one of them suddenly dropped a small scarlet insect, buzzing as it fell.

'There's the Red Rocket,' said Henry, 'just come in from New York.' Looking at his watch, 'Seven minutes behind time,' he added, and shook his head. 'These Atlantic services--they're really scandalously unpunctual.'

He took his foot off the accelerator. The humming of the screws overhead dropped an octave and a half, back through wasp and hornet to bumble-bee, to cockchafer, to stag-beetle. The upward rush of the machine slackened off; a moment later they were hanging motionless in the air. Henry pushed at a lever; there was a click. Slowly at first, then faster and faster, till it was a circular mist before their eyes, the propeller in front of them began to revolve. The wind of a horizontal speed whistled ever more shrilly in the stays. Henry kept his eye on the revolution-counter; when the needle touched the twelve hundred mark, he threw the helicopter screws out of gear. The machine had enough forward momentum to be able to fly on its planes.

Lenina looked down through the window in the floor between her feet. They were flying over the six kilometre zone of park-land that separated Central London from its first ring of satellite suburbs. The green was maggoty with foreshortened life. Forests of Centrifugal Bumble-puppy towers gleamed between the trees. Near Shepherd's Bush two thousand Beta-Minus mixed doubles were playing Riemann-surface tennis. A double row of Escalator Fives Courts lined the main road from Notting Hill to Willesden. In the Ealing stadium a Delta gymnastic display and community sing was in progress.

'What a hideous colour khaki is,' remarked Lenina, voicing the hypnopædic prejudices of her caste.

The buildings of the Hounslow Feely Studio covered seven and a half hectares. Near them a black and khaki army of labourers was busy revitrifying the surface of the Great West Road. One of the huge travelling crucibles was being tapped as they flew over. The molten stone poured out in a stream of dazzling incandescence across the road; the asbestos rollers came and went; at the tail of an insulated watering-cart the steam rose in white clouds.

At Brentford the Television Corporation's factory was like a small town.

'They must be changing the shift,' said Lenina.

Like aphides and ants, the leaf-green Gamma girls, the black Semi-Morons swarmed round the entrances, or stood in queues to take their places in the monorail tram-cars. Mulberry-coloured Beta-Minuses came and went among the crowd. The roof of the main building was alive with the alighting and departure of helicopters.

'My word,' said Lenina, 'I'm glad I'm not a Gamma.'

Ten minutes later they were at Stoke Poges and had started their first round of Obstacle Golf.

§ 2
With eyes for the most part downcast and, if ever they lighted on a fellow creature, at once and furtively averted, Bernard hastened across the roof. He was like a man pursued, but pursued by enemies he does not wish to see, lest they should seem more hostile even than he had supposed, and he himself be made to feel guiltier and even more helplessly alone.

'That horrible Benito Hoover!' And yet the man had meant well enough. Which only made it, in a way, much worse. Those who meant well behaved in the same way as those who meant badly. Even Lenina was making him suffer. He remembered those weeks of timid indecision, during which he had looked and longed and despaired of ever having the courage to ask her. Dared he face the risk of being humiliated by a contemptuous refusal? But if she were to say yes, what rapture! Well, now she had said it and he was still wretched--wretched that she should have thought it such a perfect afternoon for Obstacle Golf, that she should have trotted away to join Henry Foster, that she should have found him funny for not wanting to talk of their most private affairs in public. Wretched, in a word, because she had behaved as any healthy and virtuous English girl ought to behave and not in some other, abnormal, extraordinary way.

He opened the door of his lock-up and called to a lounging couple of Delta-Minus attendants to come and push his machine out on to the roof. The hangars were staffed by a single Bokanovsky Group, and the men were twins, identically small, black and hideous. Bernard gave his orders in the sharp, rather arrogant and even offensive tone of one who does not feel himself too secure in his superiority. To have dealings with members of the lower castes was always, for Bernard, a most distressing experience. For whatever the cause (and the current gossip about the alcohol in his blood-surrogate may very likely--for accidents will happen--have been true) Bernard's physique was hardly better than that of the average Gamma. He stood eight centimetres short of the standard Alpha height and was slender in proportion. Contact with members of the lower castes always reminded him painfully of this physical inadequacy. 'I am I, and wish I wasn't'; his self-consciousness was acute and distressing. Each time he found himself looking on the level, instead of downward, into a Delta's face, he felt humiliated. Would the creature treat him with the respect due to his caste? The question haunted him. Not without reason. For Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons had been to some extent conditioned to associate corporeal mass with social superiority. Indeed, a faint hypnopædic prejudice in favour of size was universal. Hence the laughter of the women to whom he made proposals, the practical joking of his equals among the men. The mockery made him feel an outsider; and feeling an outsider he behaved like one, which increased the prejudice against him and intensified the contempt and hostility aroused by his physical defects. Which in turn increased his sense of being alien and alone. A chronic fear of being slighted made him avoid his equals, made him stand, where his inferiors were concerned, self-consciously on his dignity. How bitterly he envied men like Henry Foster and Benito Hoover! Men who never had to shout at an Epsilon to get an order obeyed; men who took their position for granted; men who moved through the caste system as a fish through the water--so utterly at home as to be unaware either of themselves or of the beneficent and comfortable element in which they had their being.

Slackly, it seemed to him, and with reluctance, the twin attendants wheeled his plane out on the roof.

'Hurry up!' said Bernard irritably. One of them glanced at him. Was that a kind of bestial derision that he detected in those blank grey eyes? 'Hurry up!' he shouted more loudly, and there was an ugly rasp in his voice.

He climbed into the plane and, a minute later was flying southwards, towards the river.

The various Bureaux of Propaganda and the College of Emotional Engineering were housed in a single sixty-story building in Fleet Street. In the basement and on the lower floors were the presses and offices of the three great London newspapers--The Hourly Radio, an upper-caste sheet, the pale-green Gamma Gazette, and, on khaki paper and in words exclusively of one syllable, The Delta Mirror. Then came the Bureaux of Propaganda by Television, by Feeling Picture, and by Synthetic Voice and Music respectively--twenty-two floors of them. Above were the research laboratories and the padded rooms in which the Sound-Track Writers and Synthetic Composers did their delicate work. The top eighteen floors were occupied by the College of Emotional Engineering.

Bernard landed on the roof of Propaganda House and stepped out.

'Ring down to Mr. Helmholtz Watson,' he ordered the Gamma-Plus porter, 'and tell him that Mr. Bernard Marx is waiting for him on the roof.'

He sat down and lit a cigarette.

Helmholtz Watson was writing when the message came down.

'Tell him I'm coming at once,' he said and hung up the receiver. Then, turning to his secretary, 'I'll leave you to put my things away,' he went on in the same official and impersonal tone; and, ignoring her lustrous smile, got up and walked briskly to the door.

He was a powerfully built man, deep-chested, broad-shouldered, massive, and yet quick in his movements, springy and agile. The round strong pillar of his neck supported a beautifully shaped head. His hair was dark and curly, his features strongly marked. In a forcible emphatic way, he was handsome and looked, as his secretary was never tired of repeating, every centimetre an Alpha-Plus. By profession he was a lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering (Department of Writing) and in the intervals of his educational activities, a working Emotional Engineer. He wrote regularly for The Hourly Radio, composed feely scenarios, and had the happiest knack for slogans and hypnopædic rhymes.

'Able,' was the verdict of his superiors. 'Perhaps' (and they would shake their heads, would significantly lower their voices) 'a little too able.'

Yes, a little too able; they were right. A mental excess had produced in Helmholtz Watson effects very similar to those which, in Bernard Marx, were the result of a physical defect. Too little bone and brawn had isolated Bernard from his fellow men, and the sense of this apartness, being, by all the current standards, a mental excess, became in its turn a cause of wider separation. That which had made Helmholtz so uncomfortably aware of being himself and all alone was too much ability. What the two men shared was the knowledge that they were individuals. But whereas the physically defective Bernard had suffered all his life from the consciousness of being separate, it was only quite recently that, grown aware of his mental excess, Helmholtz Watson had also become aware of his difference from the people who surrounded him. This Escalator-Squash champion, this indefatigable lover (it was said that he had had six hundred and forty different girls in under four years), this admirable committee man and best mixer had realized quite suddenly that sport, women, communal activities were only, so far as he was concerned, second bests. Really, and at the bottom, he was interested in something else. But in what? In what? That was the problem which Bernard had come to discuss with him--or rather, since it was always Helmholtz who did all the talking, to listen to his friend discussing, yet once more.

Three charming girls from the Bureau of Propaganda by Synthetic Voice waylaid him as he stepped out of the lift.

'Oh, Helmholtz darling, do come and have a picnic supper with us on Exmoor.' They clung round him imploringly.

He shook his head, he pushed his way through them. 'No, no.'

'We're not inviting any other man.'

But Helmholtz remained unshaken even by this delightful promise. 'No,' he repeated, 'I'm busy.' And he held resolutely on his course. The girls trailed after him. It was not till he had actually climbed into Bernard's plane and slammed the door that they gave up pursuit. Not without reproaches.

'These women!' he said, as the machine rose into the air. 'These women!' And he shook his head, he frowned. 'Too awful.' Bernard hypocritically agreed, wishing, as he spoke the words, that he could have as many girls as Helmholtz did, and with as little trouble. He was seized with a sudden urgent need to boast. 'I'm taking Lenina Crowne to New Mexico with me,' he said in a tone as casual as he could make it.

'Are you?' said Helmholtz, with a total absence of interest. Then after a little pause, 'This last week or two,' he went on, 'I've been cutting all my committees and all my girls. You can't imagine what a hullabaloo they've been making about it at the College. Still, it's been worth it, I think. The effects...' He hesitated. 'Well, they're odd, they're very odd.'

A physical shortcoming could produce a kind of mental excess. The process, it seemed, was reversible. Mental excess could produce, for its own purposes, the voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate solitude, the artificial impotence of asceticism.

The rest of the short flight was accomplished in silence. When they had arrived and were comfortably stretched out on the pneumatic sofas in Bernard's room, Helmholtz began again.

Speaking very slowly, 'Did you ever feel,' he asked, 'as though you had something inside you that was only waiting for you to give it a chance to come out? Some sort of extra power that you aren't using--you know, like all the water that goes down the falls instead of through the turbines?' He looked at Bernard questioningly.

'You mean all the emotions one might be feeling if things were different?'

Helmholtz shook his head. 'Not quite. I'm thinking of a queer feeling I sometimes get, a feeling that I've got something important to say and the power to say it--only I don't know what it is, and I can't make any use of the power. If there was some different way of writing... Or else something else to write about...' He was silent; then, 'You see,' he went on at last, 'I'm pretty good at inventing phrases--you know, the sort of words that suddenly make you jump, almost as though you'd sat on a pin, they seem so new and exciting even though they're about something hypnopædically obvious. But that doesn't seem enough. It's not enough for the phrases to be good; what you make with them ought to be good too.'

'But your things are good, Helmholtz.'

'Oh, as far as they go.' Helmholtz shrugged his shoulders. 'But they go such a little way. They aren't important enough, somehow. I feel I could do something much more important. Yes, and more intense, more violent. But what? What is there more important to say? And how can one be violent about the sort of things one's expected to write about? Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly--they'll go through anything. You read and you're pierced. That's one of the things I try to teach my students--how to write piercingly. But what on earth's the good of being pierced by an article about a Community Sing, or the latest improvement in scent organs? Besides, can you make words really piercing--you know, like the very hardest X-rays--when you're writing about that sort of thing? Can you say something about nothing? That's what it finally boils down to. I try and I try...'

'Hush!' said Bernard suddenly, and lifted a warning finger; they listened. 'I believe there's somebody at the door,' he whispered.

Helmholtz got up, tiptoed across the room, and with a sharp quick movement flung the door wide open. There was, of course, nobody there.

'I'm sorry,' said Bernard, feeling and looking uncomfortably foolish. 'I suppose I've got things on my nerves a bit. When people are suspicious with you, you start being suspicious with them.'

He passed his hand across his eyes, he sighed, his voice became plaintive. He was justifying himself. 'If you knew what I'd had to put up with recently,' he said almost tearfully--and the uprush of his self-pity was like a fountain suddenly released. 'If you only knew!'

Helmholtz Watson listened with a certain sense of discomfort. 'Poor little Bernard!' he said to himself. But at the same time he felt rather ashamed for his friend. He wished Bernard would show a little more pride.


Chapter V

§ 1
By eight o'clock the light was failing. The loud-speakers in the tower of the Stoke Poges Club House began, in a more than human tenor, to announce the closing of the courses. Lenina and Henry abandoned their game and walked back towards the Club. From the grounds of the Internal and External Secretion Trust came the lowing of those thousands of cattle which provided, with their hormones and their milk, the raw materials for the great factory at Farnham Royal.

An incessant buzzing of helicopters filled the twilight. Every two and a half minutes a bell and the screech of whistles announced the departure of one of the light monorail trains which carried the lower-caste golfers back from their separate course to the metropolis.

Lenina and Henry climbed into their machine and started off. At eight hundred feet Henry slowed down the helicopter screws, and they hung for a minute or two poised above the fading landscape. The forest of Burnham Beeches stretched like a great pool of darkness towards the bright shore of the western sky. Crimson at the horizon, the last of the sunset faded, through orange, upwards into yellow and a pale watery green. Northwards, beyond and above the trees, the Internal and External Secretions factory glared with a fierce electric brilliance from every window of its twenty stories. Beneath them lay the buildings of the Golf Club--the huge lower-caste barracks and, on the other side of a dividing wall, the smaller houses reserved for Alpha and Beta members. The approaches to the monorail station were black with the ant-like pullulation of lower-caste activity. From under the glass vault a lighted train shot out into the open. Following its south-easterly course across the dark plain their eyes were drawn to the majestic buildings of the Slough Crematorium. For the safety of night-flying planes, its four tall chimneys were flood-lighted and tipped with crimson danger signals. It was a landmark.

'Why do the smoke-stacks have those things like balconies round them?' enquired Lenina.

'Phosphorus recovery,' explained Henry telegraphically. 'On their way up the chimney the gases go through four separate treatments. P{2}O{5} used to go right out of circulation every time they cremated some one. Now they recover over ninety-eight per cent. of it. More than a kilo and a half per adult corpse. Which makes the best part of four hundred tons of phosphorus every year from England alone.' Henry spoke with a happy pride, rejoicing whole-heartedly in the achievement, as though it had been his own. 'Fine to think we can go on being socially useful even after we're dead. Making plants grow.'

Lenina, meanwhile, had turned her eyes away and was looking perpendicularly downwards at the monorail station. 'Fine,' she agreed. 'But queer that Alphas and Betas won't make any more plants grow than those nasty little Gammas and Deltas and Epsilons down there.'

'All men are physico-chemically equal,' said Henry sententiously. 'Besides, even Epsilons perform indispensable services.'

'Even an Epsilon...' Lenina suddenly remembered an occasion when, as a little girl at school, she had woken up in the middle of the night and become aware, for the first time, of the whispering that had haunted all her sleeps. She saw again the beam of moonlight, the row of small white beds; heard once more the soft, soft voice that said (the words were there, unforgotten, unforgettable after so many night-long repetitions): 'Every one works for every one else. We can't do without any one. Even Epsilons are useful. We couldn't do without Epsilons. Every one works for every one else. We can't do without any one...' Lenina remembered her first shock of fear and surprise; her speculations through half a wakeful hour; and then, under the influence of those endless repetitions, the gradual soothing of her mind, the soothing, the smoothing, the stealthy creeping of sleep....

'I suppose Epsilons don't really mind being Epsilons,' she said aloud.

'Of course they don't. How can they? They don't know what it's like being anything else. We'd mind, of course. But then we've been differently conditioned. Besides, we start with a different heredity.'

'I'm glad I'm not an Epsilon,' said Lenina, with conviction.

'And if you were an Epsilon,' said Henry, 'your conditioning would have made you no less thankful that you weren't a Beta or an Alpha.' He put his forward propeller into gear and headed the machine towards London. Behind them, in the west, the crimson and orange were almost faded; a dark bank of cloud had crept into the zenith. As they flew over the Crematorium, the plane shot upwards on the column of hot air rising from the chimneys, only to fall as suddenly when it passed into the descending chill beyond.

'What a marvellous switchback!' Lenina laughed delightedly.

But Henry's tone was almost, for a moment, melancholy. 'Do you know what that switchback was?' he said. 'It was some human being finally and definitely disappearing. Going up in a squirt of hot gas. It would be curious to know who it was--a man or a woman, an Alpha or an Epsilon....' He sighed. Then, in a resolutely cheerful voice, 'Anyhow,' he concluded, 'there's one thing we can be certain of; whoever he may have been, he was happy when he was alive. Everybody's happy now.'

'Yes, everybody's happy now,' echoed Lenina. They had heard the words repeated a hundred and fifty times every night for twelve years.

Landing on the roof of Henry's forty-story apartment house in Westminster, they went straight down to the dining-hall. There, in a loud and cheerful company, they ate an excellent meal. Soma was served with the coffee. Lenina took two half-gramme tablets and Henry three. At twenty past nine they walked across the street to the newly opened Westminster Abbey Cabaret. It was a night almost without clouds, moonless and starry; but of this on the whole depressing fact Lenina and Henry were fortunately unaware. The electric sky-signs effectively shut off the outer darkness. 'CALVIN STOPES AND HIS SIXTEEN SEXOPHONISTS.' From the façade of the new Abbey the giant letters invitingly glared. 'LONDON'S FINEST SCENT AND COLOUR ORGAN. ALL THE LATEST SYNTHETIC MUSIC.'

They entered. The air seemed hot and somehow breathless with the scent of ambergris and sandalwood. On the domed ceiling of the hall, the colour organ had momentarily painted a tropical sunset. The Sixteen Sexophonists were playing an old favourite: 'There ain't no Bottle in all the world like that dear little Bottle of mine.' Four hundred couples were five-stepping round the polished floor. Lenina and Henry were soon the four hundred and first. The sexophones wailed like melodious cats under the moon, moaned in the alto and tenor registers as though the little death were upon them. Rich with a wealth of harmonics, their tremulous chorus mounted towards a climax, louder and ever louder--until at last, with a wave of his hand, the conductor let loose the final shattering note of ethermusic and blew the sixteen merely human blowers clean out of existence. Thunder in A flat major. And then, in all but silence, in all but darkness, there followed a gradual deturgescence, a diminuendo sliding gradually, through quarter tones, down, down to a faintly whispered dominant chord that lingered on (while the five-four rhythms still pulsed below) charging the darkened seconds with an intense expectancy. And at last expectancy was fulfilled. There was a sudden explosive sunrise, and simultaneously, the Sixteen burst into song:

Bottle of mine, it's you I've always wanted!
Bottle of mine, why was I ever decanted?
  Skies are blue inside of you,
  The weather's always fine;
For
There ain't no Bottle in all the world
Like that dear little Bottle of mine.
Five-stepping with the other four hundred round and round Westminster Abbey, Lenina and Henry were yet dancing in another world--the warm, the richly coloured, the infinitely friendly world of soma-holiday. How kind, how good-looking, how delightfully amusing every one was! 'Bottle of mine, it's you I've always wanted...' But Lenina and Henry had what they wanted... They were inside, here and now--safely inside with the fine weather, the perennially blue sky. And when, exhausted, the Sixteen had laid by their sexophones and the Synthetic Music apparatus was producing the very latest in slow Malthusian Blues, they might have been twin embryos gently rocking together on the waves of a bottled ocean of blood-surrogate.

'Good-night, dear friends. Good-night, dear friends.' The loud-speakers veiled their commands in a genial and musical politeness. Good-night, dear friends....'

Obediently, with all the others, Lenina and Henry left the building. The depressing stars had travelled quite some way across the heavens. But though the separating screen of the sky-signs had now to a great extent dissolved, the two young people still retained their happy ignorance of the night.

Swallowed half an hour before closing time, that second dose of soma had raised a quite impenetrable wall between the actual universe and their minds. Bottled, they crossed the street; bottled, they took the lift up to Henry's room on the twenty-eighth floor. And yet, bottled as she was, and in spite of that second gramme of soma, Lenina did not forget to take all the contraceptive precautions prescribed by the regulations. Years of intensive hypnopædia and, from twelve to seventeen, Malthusian drill three times a week had made the taking of these precautions almost as automatic and inevitable as blinking.

'Oh, and that reminds me,' she said, as she came back from the bathroom, 'Fanny Crowne wants to know where you found that lovely green morocco-surrogate cartridge belt you gave me.'

§ 2
Alternate Thursdays were Bernard's Solidarity Service days. After an early dinner at the Aphroditæum (to which Helmholtz had recently been elected under Rule Two) he took leave of his friend and, hailing a taxi on the roof, told the man to fly to the Fordson Community Singery. The machine rose a couple of hundred metres, then headed eastwards, and as it turned, there before Bernard's eyes, gigantically beautiful, was the Singery. Flood-lighted, its three hundred and twenty metres of white Carrara-surrogate gleamed with a snowy incandescence over Ludgate Hill; at each of the four corners of its helicopter platform an immense T shone crimson against the night, and from the mouths of twenty-four vast golden trumpets rumbled a solemn synthetic music.

'Damn, I'm late,' Bernard said to himself as he first caught sight of Big Henry, the Singery clock. And sure enough, as he was paying off his cab, Big Henry sounded the hour. 'Ford,' sang out an immense bass voice from all the golden trumpets. 'Ford, Ford, Ford...' Nine times. Bernard ran for the lift.

The great auditorium for Ford's Day celebrations and other massed Community Sings was at the bottom of the building. Above it, a hundred to each floor, were the seven thousand rooms used by Solidarity Groups for their fortnightly services. Bernard dropped down to floor thirty-three, hurried along the corridor, stood hesitating for a moment outside Room 3210, then, having wound himself up, opened the door and walked in.

Thank Ford! he was not the last. Three chairs of the twelve arranged round the circular table were still unoccupied. He slipped into the nearest of them as inconspicuously as he could and prepared to frown at the yet later comers whenever they should arrive.

Turning towards him, 'What were you playing this afternoon?' the girl on his left enquired. 'Obstacle, or Electro-magnetic?'

Bernard looked at her (Ford! it was Morgana Rothschild) and blushingly had to admit that he had been playing neither. Morgana stared at him with astonishment. There was an awkward silence.

Then pointedly she turned away and addressed herself to the more sporting man on her left.

'A good beginning for a Solidarity Service,' thought Bernard miserably, and foresaw for himself yet another failure to achieve atonement. If only he had given himself time to look round instead of scuttling for the nearest chair! He could have sat between Fifi Bradlaugh and Joanna Diesel. Instead of which he had gone and blindly planted himself next to Morgana. Morgana! Ford! Those black eyebrows of hers--that eyebrow, rather--for they met above the nose. Ford! And on his right was Clara Deterding. True, Clara's eyebrows didn't meet. But she was really too pneumatic. Whereas Fifi and Joanna were absolutely right. Plump, blonde, not too large... And it was that great lout, Tom Kawaguchi, who now took the seat between them.

The last arrival was Sarojini Engels.

'You're late,' said the President of the Group severely. 'Don't let it happen again.'

Sarojini apologized and slid into her place between Jim Bokanovsky and Herbert Bakunin. The group was now complete, the solidarity circle perfect and without flaw. Man, woman, man, in a ring of endless alternation round the table. Twelve of them ready to be made one, waiting to come together, to be fused, to lose their twelve separate identities in a larger being.

The President stood up, made the sign of the T and, switching on the synthetic music, let loose the soft indefatigable beating of drums and a choir of instruments--near-wind and super-string--that plangently repeated and repeated the brief and unescapably haunting melody of the first Solidarity Hymn. Again, again--and it was not the ear that heard the pulsing rhythm, it was the midriff; the wail and clang of those recurring harmonies haunted, not the mind, but the yearning bowels of compassion.

The President made another sign of the T and sat down. The service had begun. The dedicated soma tablets were placed in the centre of the dinner table. The loving cup of strawberry ice-cream soma was passed from hand to hand and, with the formula, 'I drink to my annihilation,' twelve times quaffed. Then to the accompaniment of the synthetic orchestra the First Solidarity Hymn was sung.

Ford, we are twelve; oh, make us one,
  Like drops within the Social River;
Oh, make us now together run
  As swiftly as thy shining Flivver.
Twelve yearning stanzas. And then the loving cup was passed a second time. 'I drink to the Greater Being' was now the formula. All drank. Tirelessly the music played. The drums beat. The crying and clashing of the harmonies were an obsession in the melted bowels. The Second Solidarity Hymn was sung.

Come, Greater Being, Social Friend,
  Annihilating Twelve-in-One!
We long to die, for when we end,
  Our larger life has but begun.
Again twelve stanzas. By this time the soma had begun to work. Eyes shone, cheeks were flushed, the inner light of universal benevolence broke out on every face in happy, friendly smiles. Even Bernard felt himself a little melted. When Morgana Rothschild turned and beamed at him, he did his best to beam back. But the eyebrow, that black two-in-one--alas, it was still there; he couldn't ignore it, couldn't, however hard he tried. The melting hadn't gone far enough. Perhaps if he had been sitting between Fifi and Joanna... For the third time the loving cup went round. 'I drink to the imminence of His Coming,' said Morgana Rothschild, whose turn it happened to be to initiate the circular rite. Her tone was loud, exultant. She drank and passed the cup to Bernard. 'I drink to the imminence of His Coming,' he repeated, with a sincere attempt to feel that the coming was imminent; but the eyebrow continued to haunt him, and the Coming, so far as he was concerned, was horribly remote. He drank and handed the cup to Clara Deterding. 'It'll be a failure again,' he said to himself. 'I know it will.' But he went on doing his best to beam.

The loving cup had made its circuit. Lifting his hand, the President gave a signal; the chorus broke out into the third Solidarity Hymn.

Feel how the Greater Being comes!
  Rejoice and, in rejoicings, die!
Melt in the music of the drums!
  For I am you and you are I.
As verse succeeded verse the voices thrilled with an ever intenser excitement. The sense of the Coming's imminence was like an electric tension in the air. The President switched off the music and, with the final note of the final stanza, there was absolute silence--the silence of stretched expectancy, quivering and creeping with a galvanic life. The President reached out his hand; and suddenly a Voice, a deep strong Voice, more musical than any merely human voice, richer, warmer, more vibrant with love and yearning and compassion, a wonderful, mysterious, supernatural Voice spoke from above their heads. Very slowly, 'Oh, Ford, Ford, Ford,' it said diminishingly and on a descending scale. A sensation of warmth radiated thrillingly out from the solar plexus to every extremity of the bodies of those who listened; tears came into their eyes; their hearts, their bowels seemed to move within them, as though with an independent life. 'Ford!' they were melting, 'Ford!' dissolved, dissolved. Then, in another tone, suddenly, startlingly. 'Listen!' trumpeted the Voice. 'Listen!' They listened. After a pause, sunk to a whisper, but a whisper, somehow, more penetrating than the loudest cry. 'The feet of the Greater Being,' it went on, and repeated the words: 'The feet of the Greater Being.' The whisper almost expired. 'The feet of the Greater Being are on the stairs.' And once more there was silence; and the expectancy, momentarily relaxed, was stretched again, tauter, tauter, almost to the tearing point. The feet of the Greater Being--oh, they heard them, they heard them, coming softly down the stairs, coming nearer and nearer down the invisible stairs. The feet of the Greater Being. And suddenly the tearing point was reached. Her eyes staring, her lips parted, Morgana Rothschild sprang to her feet.

'I hear him,' she cried. 'I hear him.'

'He's coming,' shouted Sarojini Engels.

'Yes, he's coming, I hear him.' Fifi Bradlaugh and Tom Kawaguchi rose simultaneously to their feet.

'Oh, oh, oh!' Joanna inarticulately testified.

'He's coming!' yelled Jim Bokanovsky.

The President leaned forward and, with a touch, released a delirium of cymbals and blown brass, a fever of tom-tomming.

'Oh, he's coming!' screamed Clara Deterding. 'Aie!' and it was as though she were having her throat cut.

Feeling that it was time for him to do something, Bernard also jumped up and shouted: 'I hear him; he's coming.' But it wasn't true. He heard nothing and, for him, nobody was coming. Nobody--in spite of the music, in spite of the mounting excitement. But he waved his arms, he shouted with the best of them; and when the others began to jig and stamp and shuffle, he also jigged and shuffled.

Round they went, a circular procession of dancers, each with hands on the hips of the dancer preceding, round and round, shouting in unison, stamping to the rhythm of the music with their feet, beating it, beating it out with hands on the buttocks in front; twelve pairs of hands beating as one; as one, twelve buttocks slabbily resounding. Twelve as one, twelve as one. 'I hear him, I hear him coming.' The music quickened; faster beat the feet, faster, faster fell the rhythmic hands. And all at once a great synthetic bass boomed out the words which announced the approaching atonement and final consummation of solidarity, the coming of the Twelve-in-One, the incarnation of the Greater Being. 'Orgy-porgy,' it sang, while the tom-toms continued to beat their feverish tattoo:

Orgy-porgy, Ford and fun,
Kiss the girls and make them One.
Boys at one with girls at peace;
Orgy-porgy gives release.
'Orgy-porgy,' the dancers caught up the liturgical refrain, 'Orgy-porgy, Ford and fun, kiss the girls...' And as they sang, the lights began slowly to fade--to fade and at the same time to grow warmer, richer, redder, until at last they were dancing in the crimson twilight of an Embryo Store. 'Orgy-Porgy...' In their blood-coloured and foetal darkness the dancers continued for a while to circulate, to beat and beat out the indefatigable rhythm. 'Orgy-porgy...' Then the circle wavered, broke, fell in partial disintegration on the ring of couches which surrounded--circle enclosing circle--the table and its planetary chairs. 'Orgy-porgy...' Tenderly the deep Voice crooned and cooed; in the red twilight it was as though some enormous negro dove were hovering benevolently over the now prone or supine dancers.

****
They were standing on the roof; Big Henry had just sung eleven. The night was calm and warm.

'Wasn't it wonderful?' said Fifi Bradlaugh. 'Wasn't it simply wonderful?' She looked at Bernard with an expression of rapture, but of rapture in which there was no trace of agitation or excitement--for to be excited is still to be unsatisfied. Hers was the calm ecstasy of achieved consummation, the peace, not of mere vacant satiety and nothingness, but of balanced life, of energies at rest and in equilibrium. A rich and living peace. For the Solidarity Service had given as well as taken, drawn off only to replenish. She was full, she was made perfect, she was still more than merely herself. 'Didn't you think it was wonderful?' she insisted, looking into Bernard's face with those supernaturally shining eyes.

'Yes, I thought it was wonderful,' he lied and looked away; the sight of her transfigured face was at once an accusation and an ironical reminder of his own separateness. He was as miserably isolated now as he had been when the service began--more isolated by reason of his unreplenished emptiness, his dead satiety. Separate and unatoned, while the others were being fused into the Greater Being; alone even in Morgana's embrace--much more alone, indeed, more hopelessly himself than he had ever been in his life before. He had emerged from that crimson twilight into the common electric glare with a self-consciousness intensified to the pitch of agony. He was utterly miserable, and perhaps (her shining eyes accused him), perhaps it was his own fault. 'Quite wonderful,' he repeated; but the only thing he could think of was Morgana's eyebrow.


Chapter VI

§ 1
Odd, odd, odd, was Lenina's verdict on Bernard Marx. So odd, indeed, that in the course of the succeeding weeks she had wondered more than once whether she shouldn't change her mind about the New Mexico holiday, and go instead to the North Pole with Benito Hoover. The trouble was that she knew the North Pole, had been there with George Edzel only last summer, and what was more, found it pretty grim. Nothing to do, and the hotel too hopelessly old-fashioned--no television laid on in the bedrooms, no scent organ, only the most putrid synthetic music, and not more than twenty-five Escalator-Squash Courts for over two hundred guests. No, decidedly she couldn't face the North Pole again. Added to which, she had only been to America once before. And even then, how inadequately! A cheap week-end in New York--had it been with Jean-Jacques Habibullah or Bokanovsky Jones? She couldn't remember. Anyhow, it was of absolutely no importance. The prospect of flying West again, and for a whole week, was very inviting. Moreover, for at least three days of that week they would be in the Savage Reservation. Not more than half a dozen people in the whole Centre had ever been inside a Savage Reservation. As an Alpha-Plus psychologist, Bernard was one of the few men she knew entitled to a permit. For Lenina, the opportunity was unique. And yet, so unique also was Bernard's oddness, that she had hesitated to take it, had actually thought of risking the Pole again with funny old Benito. At least Benito was normal. Whereas Bernard...

'Alcohol in his blood-surrogate,' was Fanny's explanation of every eccentricity. But Henry, with whom, one evening when they were in bed together, Lenina had rather anxiously discussed her new lover, Henry had compared poor Bernard to a rhinoceros.

'You can't teach a rhinoceros tricks,' he had explained in his brief and vigorous style. 'Some men are almost rhinoceroses; they don't respond properly to conditioning. Poor devils! Bernard's one of them. Luckily for him, he's pretty good at his job. Otherwise the Director would never have kept him. 'However,' he added consolingly, 'I think he's pretty harmless.'

Pretty harmless, perhaps; but also pretty disquieting. That mania, to start with, for doing things in private. Which meant, in practice, not doing anything at all. For what was there that one could do in private. (Apart, of course, from going to bed: but one couldn't do that all the time.) Yes, what was there? Precious little. The first afternoon they went out together was particularly fine. Lenina had suggested a swim at the Torquay Country Club followed by dinner at the Oxford Union. But Bernard thought there would be too much of a crowd. Then what about a round of Electro-magnetic Golf at St. Andrews? But again, no: Bernard considered that Electro-magnetic Golf was a waste of time.

'Then what's time for?' asked Lenina in some astonishment.

Apparently, for going walks in the Lake District; for that was what he now proposed. Land on the top of Skiddaw and walk for a couple of hours in the heather. 'Alone with you, Lenina.'

'But, Bernard, we shall be alone all night.'

Bernard blushed and looked away. 'I meant, alone for talking,' he mumbled.

'Talking? But what about?' Walking and talking--that seemed a very odd way of spending an afternoon.

In the end she persuaded him, much against his will, to fly over to Amsterdam to see the Semi-Demi-Finals of the Women's Heavyweight Wrestling Championship.

'In a crowd,' he grumbled. 'As usual.' He remained obstinately gloomy the whole afternoon; wouldn't talk to Lenina's friends (of whom they met dozens in the ice-cream soma bar between the wrestling bouts); and in spite of his misery absolutely refused to take the half-gramme raspberry sundae which she pressed upon him. 'I'd rather be myself,' he said. 'Myself and nasty. Not somebody else, however jolly.'

'A gramme in time saves nine,' said Lenina, producing a bright treasure of sleep-taught wisdom.

Bernard pushed away the proffered glass impatiently.

'Now don't lose your temper,' she said. 'Remember, one cubic centimetre cures ten gloomy sentiments.'

'Oh, for Ford's sake, be quiet!' he shouted.

Lenina shrugged her shoulders. 'A gramme is always better than a damn,' she concluded with dignity, and drank the sundae herself.

On their way back across the Channel, Bernard insisted on stopping his propeller and hovering on his helicopter screws within a hundred feet of the waves. The weather had taken a change for the worse; a south-westerly wind had sprung up, the sky was cloudy.

'Look,' he commanded.

'But it's horrible,' said Lenina, shrinking back from the window. She was appalled by the rushing emptiness of the night, by the black foam-flecked water heaving beneath them, by the pale face of the moon, so haggard and distracted among the hastening clouds. 'Let's turn on the radio. Quick!' She reached for the dialling knob on the dash-board and turned it at random.

'...skies are blue inside of you,' sang sixteen tremoloing falsettos, 'the weather's always...'

Then a hiccough and silence. Bernard had switched off the current.

'I want to look at the sea in peace,' he said. 'One can't even look with that beastly noise going on.'

'But it's lovely. And I don't want to look.'

'But I do,' he insisted. 'It makes me feel as though...' he hesitated, searching for words with which to express himself, 'as though I were more me, if you see what I mean. More on my own, not so completely a part of something else. Not just a cell in the social body. Doesn't it make you feel like that, Lenina?'

But Lenina was crying. 'It's horrible, it's horrible,' she kept repeating. 'And how can you talk like that about not wanting to be a part of the social body? After all, every one works for every one else. We can't do without any one. Even Epsilons...'

'Yes, I know,' said Bernard derisively. '"Even Epsilons are useful"! So am I. And I damned well wish I weren't!'

Lenina was shocked by his blasphemy. 'Bernard!' she protested in a voice of amazed distress. 'How can you?'

In a different key, 'How can I?' he repeated meditatively. 'No, the real problem is: How is it that I can't, or rather--because, after all, I know quite well why I can't--what would it be like if I could, if I were free--not enslaved by my conditioning.'

'But, Bernard, you're saying the most awful things.'

'Don't you wish you were free, Lenina?'

'I don't know what you mean. I am free. Free to have the most wonderful time. Everybody's happy nowadays.'

He laughed, 'Yes, "Everybody's happy nowadays." We begin giving the children that at five. But wouldn't you like to be free to be happy in some other way, Lenina? In your own way, for example; not in everybody else's way.'

'I don't know what you mean,' she repeated. Then, turning to him, 'Oh, do let's go back, Bernard,' she besought; 'I do so hate it here.'

'Don't you like being with me?'

'But of course, Bernard! It's this horrible place.'

'I thought we'd be more... more together here--with nothing but the sea and moon. More together than in that crowd, or even in my rooms. Don't you understand that?'

'I don't understand anything,' she said with decision, determined to preserve her incomprehension intact. 'Nothing. Least of all,' she continued in another tone, 'why you don't take soma when you have these dreadful ideas of yours. You'd forget all about them. And instead of feeling miserable, you'd be jolly. So jolly,' she repeated and smiled, for all the puzzled anxiety in her eyes, with what was meant to be an inviting and voluptuous cajolery.

He looked at her in silence, his face unresponsive and very grave--looked at her intently. After a few seconds Lenina's eyes flinched away; she uttered a nervous little laugh, tried to think of something to say and couldn't. The silence prolonged itself.

When Bernard spoke at last, it was in a small tired voice. 'All right then,' he said, 'we'll go back.' And stepping hard on the accelerator, he sent the machine rocketing up into the sky. At four thousand he started his propeller. They flew in silence for a minute or two. Then, suddenly, Bernard began to laugh. Rather oddly, Lenina thought; but still, it was laughter.

'Feeling better?' she ventured to ask.

For answer, he lifted one hand from the controls and, slipping his arm round her, began to fondle her breasts.

'Thank Ford,' she said to herself, 'he's all right again.'

Half an hour later they were back in his rooms. Bernard swallowed four tablets of soma at a gulp, turned on the radio and television and began to undress.

'Well,' Lenina enquired, with significant archness when they met next afternoon on the roof, 'did you think it was fun yesterday?'

Bernard nodded. They climbed into the plane. A little jolt, and they were off.

'Every one says I'm awfully pneumatic,' said Lenina reflectively, patting her own legs.

'Awfully.' But there was an expression of pain in Bernard's eyes. 'Like meat,' he was thinking.

She looked up with a certain anxiety. 'But you don't think I'm too plump, do you?'

He shook his head. Like so much meat.

'You think I'm all right.' Another nod. 'In every way?'

'Perfect,' he said aloud. And inwardly, 'She thinks of herself that way. She doesn't mind being meat.'

Lenina smiled triumphantly. But her satisfaction was premature.

'All the same,' he went on, after a little pause, 'I still rather wish it had all ended differently.'

'Differently?' Were there other endings?

'I didn't want it to end with our going to bed,' he specified.

Lenina was astonished.

'Not at once, not the first day.'

'But then what...?'

He began to talk a lot of incomprehensible and dangerous nonsense. Lenina did her best to stop the ears of her mind; but every now and then a phrase would insist on becoming audible. '...to try the effect of arresting my impulses,' she heard him say. The words seemed to touch a spring in her mind.

'Never put off till to-morrow the fun you can have to-day,' she said gravely.

'Two hundred repetitions, twice a week from fourteen to sixteen and a half,' was all his comment. The mad bad talk rambled on. 'I want to know what passion is,' she heard him saying. 'I want to feel something strongly.'

'When the individual feels, the community reels,' Lenina pronounced.

'Well, why shouldn't it reel a bit?'

'Bernard!'

But Bernard remained unabashed.

'Adults intellectually and during working hours,' he went on. 'Infants where feeling and desire are concerned.'

'Our Ford loved infants.'

Ignoring the interruption, 'It suddenly struck me the other day,' continued Bernard, 'that it might be possible to be an adult all the time.'

'I don't understand.' Lenina's tone was firm.

'I know you don't. And that's why we went to bed together yesterday--like infants--instead of being adults and waiting.'

'But it was fun,' Lenina insisted. 'Wasn't it?'

'Oh, the greatest fun,' he answered, but in a voice so mournful, with an expression so profoundly miserable, that Lenina felt all her triumph suddenly evaporate. Perhaps he had found her too plump, after all.

'I told you so,' was all that Fanny said, when Lenina came and made her confidences. 'It's the alcohol they put in his surrogate.'

'All the same,' Lenina insisted. 'I do like him. He has such awfully nice hands. And the way he moves his shoulders--that's very attractive.' She sighed. 'But I wish he weren't so odd.'

§ 2
Halting for a moment outside the door of the Director's room, Bernard drew a deep breath and squared his shoulders, bracing himself to meet the dislike and disapproval which he was certain of finding within. He knocked and entered.

'A permit for you to initial, Director,' he said as airily as possible, and laid the paper on the writing-table.

The Director glanced at him sourly. But the stamp of the World Controller's Office was at the head of the paper and the signature of Mustapha Mond, bold and black, across the bottom. Everything was perfectly in order. The Director had no choice. He pencilled his initials--two small pale letters abject at the feet of Mustapha Mond----and was about to return the paper without a word of comment or genial Ford-speed, when his eye was caught by something written in the body of the permit.

'For the New Mexican Reservation?' he said, and his tone, the face he lifted to Bernard, expressed a kind of agitated astonishment.

Surprised by his surprise, Bernard nodded. There was a silence.

The Director leaned back in his chair, frowning. 'How long ago was it?' he said, speaking more to himself than to Bernard. 'Twenty years, I suppose. Nearer twenty-five. I must have been your age...' He sighed and shook his head.

Bernard felt extremely uncomfortable. A man so conventional, so scrupulously correct as the Director--and to commit so gross a solecism! It made him want to hide his face, to run out of the room. Not that he himself saw anything intrinsically objectionable in people talking about the remote past; that was one of those hypnopædic prejudices he had (so he imagined) completely got rid of. What made him feel shy was the knowledge that the Director disapproved--disapproved and yet had been betrayed into doing the forbidden thing. Under what inward compulsion? Through his discomfort Bernard eagerly listened.

'I had the same idea as you,' the Director was saying. 'Wanted to have a look at the savages. Got a permit for New Mexico and went there for my summer holiday. With the girl I was having at the moment. She was a Beta-Minus, and I think' (he shut his eyes). 'I think she had yellow hair. Anyhow, she was pneumatic, particularly pneumatic; I remember that. Well, we went there, and we looked at the savages, and we rode about on horses and all that. And then--it was almost the last day of my leave--then... well, she got lost. We'd gone riding up one of those revolting mountains, and it was horribly hot and oppressive, and after lunch we went to sleep. Or at least I did. She must have gone for a walk, alone. At any rate, when I woke up, she wasn't there. And the most frightful thunderstorm I've ever seen was just bursting on us. And it poured and roared and flashed; and the horses broke loose and ran away; and I fell down, trying to catch them, and hurt my knee, so that I could hardly walk. Still, I searched and I shouted and I searched. But there was no sign of her. Then I thought she must have gone back to the rest-house by herself. So I crawled down into the valley by the way we had come. My knee was agonizingly painful, and I'd lost my soma. It took me hours. I didn't get back to the rest-house till after midnight. And she wasn't there; she wasn't there,' the Director repeated. There was a silence. 'Well,' he resumed at last, 'the next day there was a search. But we couldn't find her. She must have fallen into a gulley somewhere; or been eaten by a mountain lion. Ford knows. Anyhow it was horrible. It upset me very much at the time. More than it ought to have done, I dare say. Because, after all, it's the sort of accident that might have happened to any one; and, of course, the social body persists although the component cells may change.' But this sleep-taught consolation did not seem to be very effective. Shaking his head, 'I actually dream about it sometimes,' the Director went on in a low voice. 'Dream of being woken up by that peal of thunder and finding her gone; dream of searching and searching for her under the trees.' He lapsed into the silence of reminiscence.

'You must have had a terrible shock,' said Bernard, almost enviously.

At the sound of his voice the Director started into a guilty realization of where he was; shot a glance at Bernard, and averting his eyes, blushed darkly; looked at him again with sudden suspicion and, angrily on his dignity, 'Don't imagine,' he said, 'that I'd had any indecorous relation with the girl. Nothing emotional, nothing long-drawn. It was all perfectly healthy and normal.' He handed Bernard the permit. 'I really don't know why I bored you with this trivial anecdote.' Furious with himself for having given away a discreditable secret, he vented his rage on Bernard. The look in his eyes was now frankly malignant. 'And I should like to take this opportunity, Mr. Marx,' he went on, 'of saying that I'm not at all pleased with the reports I receive of your behaviour outside working hours. You may say that this is not my business. But it is. I have the good name of the Centre to think of. My workers must be above suspicion, particularly those of the highest castes. Alphas are so conditioned that they do not have to be infantile in their emotional behaviour. But that is all the more reason for their making a special effort to conform. It is their duty to be infantile, even against their inclination. And so, Mr. Marx, I give you fair warning.' The Director's voice vibrated with an indignation that had now become wholly righteous and impersonal--was the expression of the disapproval of Society itself. 'If ever I hear again of any lapse from a proper standard of infantile decorum, I shall ask for your transference to a Sub-Centre--preferably to Iceland. Good morning.' And swivelling round in his chair, he picked up his pen and began to write.

'That'll teach him,' he said to himself. But he was mistaken. For Bernard left the room with a swagger, exulting, as he banged the door behind him, in the thought that he stood alone, embattled against the order of things; elated by the intoxicating consciousness of his individual significance and importance. Even the thought of persecution left him undismayed, was rather tonic than depressing. He felt strong enough to meet and overcome affliction, strong enough to face even Iceland. And this confidence was the greater for his not for a moment really believing that he would be called upon to face anything at all. People simply weren't transferred for things like that. Iceland was just a threat. A most stimulating and life-giving threat. Walking along the corridor, he actually whistled.

Heroic was the account he gave that evening of his interview with the D.H.C. 'Whereupon,' it concluded, 'I simply told him to go to the Bottomless Past and marched out of the room. And that was that.' He looked at Helmholtz Watson expectantly, awaiting his due reward of sympathy, encouragement, admiration. But no word came. Helmholtz sat silent, staring at the floor.

He liked Bernard; he was grateful to him for being the only man of his acquaintance with whom he could talk about the subjects he felt to be important. Nevertheless, there were things in Bernard which he hated. This boasting, for example. And the outbursts of an abject self-pity with which it alternated. And his deplorable habit of being bold after the event, and full, in absence, of the most extraordinary presence of mind. He hated these things--just because he liked Bernard. The seconds passed. Helmholtz continued to stare at the floor. And suddenly Bernard blushed and turned away.

§ 3
The journey was quite uneventful. The Blue Pacific Rocket was two and a half minutes early at New Orleans, lost four minutes in a tornado over Texas, but flew into a favourable air current at Longitude 95 West, and was able to land at Santa Fé less than forty seconds behind schedule time.

'Forty seconds on a six and a half hour flight. Not so bad,' Lenina conceded.

They slept that night at Santa Fé. The hotel was excellent--incomparably better, for example, than that horrible Aurora Bora Palace in which Lenina had suffered so much the previous summer. Liquid air, television, vibro-vacuum massage, radio, boiling caffeine solution, hot contraceptives, and eight different kinds of scent were laid on in every bedroom. The synthetic music plant was working as they entered the hall and left nothing to be desired. A notice in the lift announced that there were sixty Escalator-Squash-Racquet Courts in the hotel, and that Obstacle and Electro-magnetic Golf could both be played in the park.

'But it sounds simply too lovely,' cried Lenina. I almost wish we could stay here. Sixty Escalator-Squash Courts...'

'There won't be any in the Reservation,' Bernard warned her. 'And no scent, no television, no hot water, even. If you feel you can't stand it, stay here till I come back.'

Lenina was quite offended. 'Of course I can stand it. I only said it was lovely here because... well, because progress is lovely, isn't it?'

'Five hundred repetitions once a week from thirteen to seventeen,' said Bernard wearily, as though to himself.

'What did you say?'

'I said that progress was lovely. That's why you mustn't come to the Reservation unless you really want to.'

'But I do want to.'

'Very well, then,' said Bernard; and it was almost a threat.

Their permit required the signature of the Warden of the Reservation, at whose office next morning they duly presented themselves. An Epsilon-Plus negro porter took in Bernard's card, and they were admitted almost immediately.

The Warden was a blond and brachycephalic Alpha-Minus, short, red, moon-faced, and broad-shouldered, with a loud booming voice, very well adapted to the utterance of hypnopædic wisdom. He was a mine of irrelevant information and unasked-for good advice. Once started, he went on and on--boomingly.

'...five hundred and sixty thousand square kilometres, divided into four distinct Sub-Reservations, each surrounded by a high-tension wire fence.'

At this moment, and for no apparent reason, Bernard suddenly remembered that he had left the eau-de-Cologne tap in his bathroom wide open and running.

'...supplied with current from the Grand Canyon hydro-electric station.'

'Cost me a fortune by the time I get back.' With his mind's eye, Bernard saw the needle on the scent meter creeping round and round, ant-like, indefatigably. 'Quickly telephone to Helmholtz Watson.'

'...upwards of five thousand kilometres of fencing at sixty thousand volts.'

'You don't say so,' said Lenina politely, not knowing in the least what the Warden had said, but taking her cue from his dramatic pause. When the Warden started booming, she had inconspicuously swallowed half a gramme of soma, with the result that she could now sit, serenely not listening, thinking of nothing at all, but with her large blue eyes fixed on the Warden's face in an expression of rapt attention.

'To touch the fence is instant death,' pronounced the Warden solemnly. 'There is no escape from a Savage Reservation.'

The word 'escape' was suggestive. 'Perhaps,' said Bernard, half rising, 'we ought to think of going.' The little black needle was scurrying, an insect, nibbling through time, eating into his money.

'No escape,' repeated the Warden, waving him back into his chair; and as the permit was not yet countersigned, Bernard had no choice but to obey. 'Those who are born in the Reservation--and remember, my dear young lady,' he added, leering obscenely at Lenina, and speaking in an improper whisper, 'remember that, in the Reservation, children still are born, yes, actually born, revolting as that may seem...' (He hoped that this reference to a shameful subject would make Lenina blush; but she only smiled with simulated intelligence and said, 'You don't say so!' Disappointed, the Warden began again.) 'Those, I repeat, who are born in the Reservation are destined to die there.'

Destined to die... A decilitre of eau-de-Cologne every minute. Six litres an hour. 'Perhaps,' Bernard tried again, 'we ought...'

Leaning forward, the Director tapped the table with his forefinger. 'You ask me how many people live in the Reservation. And I reply'--triumphantly--'I reply that we do not know. We can only guess.'

'You don't say so.'

'My dear young lady, I do say so.'

Six times twenty-four--no, it would be nearer six times thirty-six. Bernard was pale and trembling with impatience. But inexorably the booming continued.

'...about sixty thousand Indians and half-breeds... absolute savages... our inspectors occasionally visit... otherwise, no communication whatever with the civilized world... still preserve their repulsive habits and customs... marriage, if you know what that is, my dear young lady; families... no conditioning... monstrous superstitions... Christianity and totemism and ancestor worship... extinct languages, such as Zuñi and Spanish and Athapascan... pumas, porcupines and other ferocious animals... infectious diseases... priests... venomous lizards...'

'You don't say so?'

They got away at last. Bernard dashed to the telephone. Quick, quick; but it took him nearly three minutes to get on to Helmholtz Watson. 'We might be among the savages already,' he complained. 'Damned incompetence!'

'Have a gramme,' suggested Lenina.

He refused, preferring his anger. And at last, thank Ford, he was through and, yes, it was Helmholtz; Helmholtz, to whom he explained what had happened, and who promised to go round at once, at once, and turn off the tap, yes, at once, but took this opportunity to tell him what the D.H.C. had said, in public, yesterday evening...

'What? He's looking out for some one to take my place?' Bernard's voice was agonized. 'So it's actually decided? Did he mention Iceland? You say he did? Ford! Iceland...' He hung up the receiver and turned back to Lenina. His face was pale, his expression utterly dejected.

'What's the matter?' she asked.

'The matter?' He dropped heavily into a chair. 'I'm going to be sent to Iceland.'

Often in the past he had wondered what it would be like to be subjected (soma-less and with nothing but his own inward resources to rely on) to some great trial, some pain, some persecution; he had even longed for affliction. As recently as a week ago, in the Director's office, he had imagined himself courageously resisting, stoically accepting suffering without a word. The Director's threats had actually elated him, made him feel larger than life. But that, as he now realized, was because he had not taken the threats quite seriously; he had not believed that, when it came to the point, the D.H.C. would ever do anything. Now that it looked as though the threats were really to be fulfilled, Bernard was appalled. Of that imagined stoicism, that theoretical courage, not a trace was left.

He raged against himself--what a fool!--against the Director--how unfair not to give him that other chance, that other chance which, he now had no doubt at all, he had always intended to take. And Iceland, Iceland...

Lenina shook her head. 'Was and will make me ill,' she quoted, 'I take a gramme and only am.'

In the end she persuaded him to swallow four tablets of soma. Five minutes later roots and fruits were abolished; the flower of the present rosily blossomed. A message from the porter announced that, at the Warden's orders, a Reservation Guard had come round with a plane and was waiting on the roof of the hotel. They went up at once. An octoroon in Gamma-green uniform saluted and proceeded to recite the morning's programme.

A bird's-eye view of ten or a dozen of the principal pueblos, then a landing for lunch in the valley of Malpais. The rest-house was comfortable there, and up at the pueblo the savages would probably be celebrating their summer festival. It would be the best place to spend the night.

They took their seats in the plane and set off. Ten minutes later they were crossing the frontier that separated civilization from savagery. Uphill and down, across the deserts of salt or sand, through forests, into the violet depth of canyons, over crag and peak and table-topped mesa, the fence marched on and on, irresistibly the straight line, the geometrical symbol of triumphant human purpose. And at its foot, here and there, a mosaic of white bones, a still unrotted carcase dark on the tawny ground marked the place where deer or steer, puma or porcupine or coyote, or the greedy turkey buzzards drawn down by the whiff of carrion and fulminated as though by a poetic justice, had come too close to the destroying wires.

'They never learn,' said the green-uniformed pilot, pointing down at the skeletons on the ground below them. 'And they never will learn,' he added and laughed, as though he had somehow scored a personal triumph over the electrocuted animals.

Bernard also laughed; after two grammes of soma the joke seemed, for some reason, good. Laughed and then, almost immediately, dropped off to sleep and, sleeping, was carried over Taos and Tesuque; over Nambe and Picuris and Pojoaque, over Sia and Cochiti, over Laguna and Acoma and the Enchanted Mesa, over Zuñi and Cibola and Ojo Caliente, and woke at last to find the machine standing on the ground, Lenina carrying the suit-cases into a small square house, and the Gamma-green octoroon talking incomprehensibly with a young Indian.

'Malpais,' explained the pilot, as Bernard stepped out. 'This is the rest-house. And there's a dance this afternoon at the pueblo. He'll take you there.' He pointed to the sullen young savage. 'Funny, I expect.' He grinned. 'Everything they do is funny.' And with that he climbed into the plane and started up the engines. 'Back to-morrow. And remember,' he added reassuringly to Lenina, 'they're perfectly tame; savages won't do you any harm. They've got enough experience of gas bombs to know that they mustn't play any tricks.' Still laughing, he threw the helicopter screws into gear, accelerated, and was gone.


Chapter VII

The mesa was like a ship becalmed in a strait of lion-coloured dust. The channel wound between precipitous banks, and slanting from one wall to the other across the valley ran a streak of green--the river and its fields. On the prow of that stone ship in the centre of the strait, and seemingly a part of it, a shaped and geometrical outcrop of the naked rock, stood the pueblo of Malpais. Block above block, each story smaller than the one below, the tall houses rose like stepped and amputated pyramids into the blue sky. At their feet lay a straggle of low buildings, a criss-cross of walls; and on three sides the precipices fell sheer into the plain. A few columns of smoke mounted perpendicularly into the windless air and were lost.

'Queer,' said Lenina. 'Very queer.' It was her ordinary word of condemnation. 'I don't like it. And I don't like that man.' She pointed to the Indian guide who had been appointed to take them up to the pueblo. Her feeling was evidently reciprocated; the very back of the man, as he walked along before them, was hostile, sullenly contemptuous.

'Besides,' she lowered her voice, 'he smells.'

Bernard did not attempt to deny it. They walked on.

Suddenly it was as though the whole air had come alive and were pulsing, pulsing with the indefatigable movement of blood. Up there, in Malpais, the drums were being beaten. Their feet fell in with the rhythm of that mysterious heart; they quickened their pace. Their path led them to the foot of the precipice. The sides of the great mesa ship towered over them, three hundred feet to the gunwale.

'I wish we could have brought the plane,' said Lenina, looking up resentfully at the blank impending rock-face. 'I hate walking. And you feel so small when you're on the ground at the bottom of a hill.'

They walked along for some way in the shadow of the mesa, rounded a projection, and there, in a water-worn ravine, was the way up the companion ladder. They climbed. It was a very steep path that zigzagged from side to side of the gulley. Sometimes the pulsing of the drums was all but inaudible, at others they seemed to be beating only just round the corner.

When they were half-way up, an eagle flew past so close to them that the wind of his wings blew chill on their faces. In a crevice of the rock lay a pile of bones. It was all oppressively queer, and the Indian smelt stronger and stronger. They emerged at last from the ravine into the full sunlight. The top of the mesa was a flat deck of stone.

'Like the Charing-T Tower,' was Lenina's comment. But she was not allowed to enjoy her discovery of this reassuring resemblance for long. A padding of soft feet made them turn round. Naked from throat to navel, their dark-brown bodies painted with white lines ('like asphalt tennis courts,' Lenina was later to explain), their faces inhuman with daubings of scarlet, black and ochre, two Indians came running along the path. Their black hair was braided with fox fur and red flannel. Cloaks of turkey feathers fluttered from their shoulders; huge feather diadems exploded gaudily round their heads. With every step they took came the clink and rattle of their silver bracelets, their heavy necklaces of bone and turquoise beads. They came on without a word, running quietly in their deerskin moccasins. One of them was holding a feather brush; the other carried, in either hand, what looked at a distance like three or four pieces of thick rope. One of the ropes writhed uneasily, and suddenly Lenina saw that they were snakes.

The men came nearer and nearer; their dark eyes looked at her, but without giving any sign of recognition, any smallest sign that they had seen her or were aware of her existence. The writhing snake hung limp again with the rest. The men passed.

'I don't like it,' said Lenina. 'I don't like it.'

She liked even less what awaited her at the entrance to the pueblo, where their guide had left them while he went inside for instructions. The dirt, to start with, the piles of rubbish, the dust, the dogs, the flies. Her face wrinkled up into a grimace of disgust. She held her handkerchief to her nose.

'But how can they live like this?' she broke out in a voice of indignant incredulity. (It wasn't possible.)

Bernard shrugged his shoulders philosophically. 'Anyhow,' he said, 'they've been doing it for the last five or six thousand years. So I suppose they must be used to it by now.'

'But cleanliness is next to fordliness,' she insisted.

'Yes, and civilization is sterilization,' Bernard went on, concluding on a tone of irony the second hypnopædic lesson in elementary hygiene. 'But these people have never heard of Our Ford, and they aren't civilized. So there's no point in...'

'Oh!' She gripped his arm. 'Look.'

An almost naked Indian was very slowly climbing down the ladder from the first-floor terrace of a neighbouring house--rung after rung, with the tremulous caution of extreme old age. His face was profoundly wrinkled and black, like a mask of obsidian. The toothless mouth had fallen in. At the corners of the lips, and on each side of the chin a few long bristles gleamed almost white against the dark skin. The long unbraided hair hung down in grey wisps round his face. His body was bent and emaciated to the bone, almost fleshless. Very slowly he came down, pausing at each rung before he ventured another step.

'What's the matter with him?' whispered Lenina. Her eyes were wide with horror and amazement.

'He's old, that's all,' Bernard answered as carelessly as he could. He too was startled; but he made an effort to seem unmoved.

'Old?' she repeated. 'But the Director's old; lots of people are old; they're not like that.'

'That's because we don't allow them to be like that. We preserve them from diseases. We keep their internal secretions artificially balanced at a youthful equilibrium. We don't permit their magnesium-calcium ratio to fall below what it was at thirty. We give them transfusions of young blood. We keep their metabolism permanently stimulated. So, of course, they don't look like that. Partly,' he added, 'because most of them die long before they reach this old creature's age. Youth almost unimpaired till sixty, and then, crack! the end.'

But Lenina was not listening. She was watching the old man. Slowly, slowly he came down. His feet touched the ground. He turned. In their deep-sunken orbits his eyes were still extraordinarily bright. They looked at her for a long moment expressionlessly, without surprise, as though she had not been there at all. Then slowly, with bent back, the old man hobbled past them and was gone.

'But it's terrible,' Lenina whispered. 'It's awful. We ought not to have come here.' She felt in her pocket for her soma--only to discover that, by some unprecedented oversight, she had left the bottle down at the rest-house. Bernard's pockets were also empty.

Lenina was left to face the horrors of Malpais unaided. They came crowding in on her thick and fast. The spectacle of two young women giving the breast to their babies made her blush and turn away her face. She had never seen anything so indecent in her life. And what made it worse was that, instead of tactfully ignoring it, Bernard proceeded to make open comments on this revoltingly viviparous scene. Ashamed, now that the effects of the soma had worn off, of the weakness he had displayed that morning in the hotel, he went out of his way to show himself strong and unorthodox.

'What a wonderfully intimate relationship,' he said, deliberately outrageous. 'And what an intensity of feeling it must generate! I often think one may have missed something in not having had a mother. And perhaps you've missed something in not being a mother, Lenina. Imagine yourself sitting there with a little baby of your own....'

'Bernard! How can you?' The passage of an old woman with ophthalmia and a disease of the skin distracted her from her indignation.

'Let's go away,' she begged. 'I don't like it.'

But at this moment their guide came back and, beckoning to them to follow, led the way down the narrow street between the houses. They rounded a corner. A dead dog was lying on a rubbish heap; a woman with a goitre was looking for lice in the hair of a small girl. Their guide halted at the foot of a ladder, raised his hand perpendicularly, then darted it horizontally forward. They did what he mutely commanded--climbed the ladder and walked through the doorway, to which it gave access, into a long narrow room, rather dark and smelling of smoke and cooked grease and long-worn, long-unwashed clothes. At the further end of the room was another doorway, through which came a shaft of sunlight and the noise, very loud and close, of the drums.

They stepped across the threshold and found themselves on a wide terrace. Below them, shut in by the tall houses, was the village square, crowded with Indians. Bright blankets, and feathers in black hair, and the glint of turquoise, and dark skins shining with heat. Lenina put her handkerchief to her nose again. In the open space at the centre of the square were two circular platforms of masonry and trampled clay--the roofs, it was evident, of underground chambers; for in the centre of each platform was an open hatchway, with a ladder emerging from the lower darkness. A sound of subterranean flute-playing came up and was almost lost in the steady remorseless persistence of the drums.

Lenina liked the drums. Shutting her eyes she abandoned herself to their soft repeated thunder, allowed it to invade her consciousness more and more completely, till at last there was nothing left in the world but that one deep pulse of sound. It reminded her reassuringly of the synthetic noises made at Solidarity Services and Ford's Day celebrations. 'Orgy-porgy,' she whispered to herself. These drums beat out just the same rhythms.

There was a sudden startling burst of singing--hundreds of male voices crying out fiercely in harsh metallic unison. A few long notes and silence, the thunderous silence of the drums; then shrill, in a neighing treble, the women's answer. Then again the drums; and once more the men's deep savage affirmation of their manhood.

Queer--yes. The place was queer, so was the music, so were the clothes and the goitres and the skin diseases and the old people. But the performance itself--there seemed to be nothing specially queer about that.

'It reminds me of a lower-caste Community Sing,' she told Bernard.

But a little later it was reminding her a good deal less of that innocuous function. For suddenly there had swarmed up from those round chambers underground a ghastly troop of monsters. Hideously masked or painted out of all semblance of humanity, they had tramped out a strange limping dance round the square; round and again round, singing as they went, round and round--each time a little faster; and the drums had changed and quickened their rhythm, so that it became like the pulsing of fever in the ears; and the crowd had begun to sing with the dancers, louder and louder; and first one woman had shrieked, and then another and another, as though they were being killed; and then suddenly the leader of the dancers broke out of the line, ran to a big wooden chest which was standing at one end of the square, raised the lid and pulled out a pair of black snakes. A great yell went up from the crowd, and all the other dancers ran towards him with outstretched hands. He tossed the snakes to the first-comers, then dipped back into the chest for more. More and more, black snakes and brown and mottled--he flung them out. And then the dance began again on a different rhythm. Round and round they went with their snakes, snakily, with a soft undulating movement at the knees and hips. Round and round. Then the leader gave a signal, and one after another, all the snakes were flung down in the middle of the square; an old man came up from underground and sprinkled them with corn meal, and from the other hatchway came a woman and sprinkled them with water from a black jar. Then the old man lifted his hand and, startlingly, terrifyingly, there was absolute silence. The drums stopped beating, life seemed to have come to an end. The old man pointed towards the two hatchways that gave entrance to the lower world. And slowly, raised by invisible hands from below, there emerged from the one a painted image of an eagle, from the other that of a man, naked, and nailed to a cross. They hung there, seemingly self-sustained, as though watching. The old man clapped his hands. Naked but for a white cotton breech-cloth, a boy of about eighteen stepped out of the crowd and stood before him, his hands crossed over his chest, his head bowed. The old man made the sign of the cross over him and turned away. Slowly, the boy began to walk round the writhing heap of snakes. He had completed the first circuit and was half-way through the second when, from among the dancers, a tall man wearing the mask of a coyote and holding in his hand a whip of plaited leather, advanced towards him. The boy moved on as though unaware of the other's existence. The coyote-man raised his whip; there was a long moment of expectancy, then a swift movement, the whistle of the lash and its loud flat-sounding impact on the flesh. The boy's body quivered; but he made no sound, he walked on at the same slow, steady pace. The coyote struck again, again; and at every blow at first a gasp and then a deep groan went up from the crowd. The boy walked on. Twice, thrice, four times round he went. The blood was streaming. Five times round, six times round. Suddenly Lenina covered her face with her hands and began to sob. 'Oh, stop them, stop them!' she implored. But the whip fell and fell inexorably. Seven times round. Then all at once the boy staggered and, still without a sound, pitched forward on to his face. Bending over him, the old man touched his back with a long white feather, held it up for a moment, crimson, for the people to see, then shook it thrice over the snakes. A few drops fell, and suddenly the drums broke out again into a panic of hurrying notes; there was a great shout. The dancers rushed forward, picked up the snakes and ran out of the square. Men, women, children, all the crowd ran after them. A minute later the square was empty, only the boy remained, prone where he had fallen, quite still. Three old women came out of one of the houses, and with some difficulty lifted him and carried him in. The eagle and the man on the cross kept guard for a little while over the empty pueblo; then, as though they had seen enough, sank slowly down through their hatchways, out of sight, into the nether world.

Lenina was still sobbing. 'Too awful,' she kept repeating, and all Bernard's consolations were in vain. 'Too awful! That blood!' She shuddered. 'Oh, I wish I had my soma.'

There was the sound of feet in the inner room.

Lenina did not move, but sat with her face in her hands, unseeing, apart. Only Bernard turned round.

The dress of the young man who now stepped out on to the terrace was Indian; but his plaited hair was straw-coloured, his eyes a pale blue, and his skin a white skin, bronzed.

'Hullo. Good-morrow,' said the stranger, in faultless but peculiar English. 'You're civilized, aren't you? You come from the Other Place, outside the Reservation?'

'Who on earth...?' Bernard began in astonishment.

The young man sighed and shook his head. 'A most unhappy gentleman.' And, pointing to the bloodstains in the centre of the square, 'Do you see that damned spot?' he asked in a voice that trembled with emotion.

'A gramme is better than a damn,' said Lenina mechanically from behind her hands. 'I wish I had my soma!'

'I ought to have been there.' The young man went on. 'Why wouldn't they let me be the sacrifice? I'd have gone round ten times--twelve, fifteen. Palowhtiwa only got as far as seven. They could have had twice as much blood from me. The multitudinous seas incarnadine.' He flung out his arms in a lavish gesture; then, despairingly, let them fall again. 'But they wouldn't let me. They disliked me for my complexion. It's always been like that. Always.' Tears stood in the young man's eyes; he was ashamed and turned away.

Astonishment made Lenina forget the deprivation of soma. She uncovered her face and, for the first time, looked at the stranger. 'Do you mean to say that you wanted to be hit with that whip?'

Still averted from her, the young man made a sign of affirmation. 'For the sake of the pueblo--to make the rain come and the corn grow. And to please Pookong and Jesus. And then to show that I can bear pain without crying out. Yes,' and his voice suddenly took on a new resonance, he turned with a proud squaring of the shoulders, a proud, defiant lifting of the chin, 'to show that I'm a man... Oh!' He gave a gasp and was silent, gaping. He had seen, for the first time in his life, the face of a girl whose cheeks were not the colour of chocolate or dogskin, whose hair was auburn and permanently waved, and whose expression (amazing novelty!) was one of benevolent interest. Lenina was smiling at him; such a nice-looking boy, she was thinking, and a really beautiful body. The blood rushed up into the young man's face; he dropped his eyes, raised them again for a moment only to find her still smiling at him, and was so much overcome that he had to turn away and pretend to be looking very hard at something on the other side of the square.

Bernard's questions made a diversion. Who? How? When? From where? Keeping his eyes fixed on Bernard's face (for so passionately did he long to see Lenina smiling that he simply dared not look at her), the young man tried to explain himself. Linda and he--Linda was his mother (the word made Lenina look uncomfortable)--were strangers in the Reservation. Linda had come from the Other Place long ago, before he was born, with a man who was his father. (Bernard pricked up his ears.) She had gone walking alone in those mountains over there to the North, had fallen down a steep place and hurt her head. ('Go on, go on,' said Bernard excitedly.) Some hunters from Malpais had found her and brought her to the pueblo. As for the man who was his father, Linda had never seen him again. His name was Tomakin. (Yes, 'Thomas' was the D.H.C.'s first name.) He must have flown away, back to the Other Place, away without her--a bad, unkind, unnatural man.

'And so I was born in Malpais,' he concluded. 'In Malpais.' And he shook his head.

****
The squalor of that little house on the outskirts of the pueblo!

A space of dust and rubbish separated it from the village. Two famine-stricken dogs were nosing obscenely in the garbage at its door. Inside, when they entered, the twilight stank and was loud with flies.

'Linda!' the young man called.

From the inner room a rather hoarse female voice said, 'Coming.'

They waited. In bowls on the floor were the remains of a meal, perhaps of several meals.

The door opened. A very stout blonde squaw stepped across the threshold and stood looking at the strangers, staring incredulously, her mouth open. Lenina noticed with disgust that two of the front teeth were missing. And the colour of the ones that remained... She shuddered. It was worse than the old man. So fat. And all the lines in her face, the flabbiness, the wrinkles. And the sagging cheeks, with those purplish blotches. And the red veins on her nose, the bloodshot eyes. And that neck--that neck; and the blanket she wore over her head--ragged and filthy. And under the brown sack-shaped tunic those enormous breasts, the bulge of the stomach, the hips. Oh, much worse than the old man, much worse! And suddenly the creature burst out in a torrent of speech, rushed at her with outstretched arms and--Ford! Ford! it was too revolting, in another moment she'd be sick--pressed her against the bulge, the bosom, and began to kiss her. Ford! to kiss, slobberingly, and smelt too horrible, obviously never had a bath, and simply reeked of that beastly stuff that was put into Delta and Epsilon bottles (no, it wasn't true about Bernard), positively stank of alcohol. She broke away as quickly as she could.

A blubbered and distorted face confronted her; the creature was crying.

'Oh, my dear, my dear.' The torrent of words flowed sobbingly. 'If you knew how glad--after all these years! A civilized face. Yes, and civilized clothes. Because I thought I should never see a piece of real acetate silk again.' She fingered the sleeve of Lenina's shirt. The nails were black. 'And those adorable viscose velveteen shorts! Do you know, dear, I've still got my old clothes, the ones I came in, put away in a box. I'll show them you afterwards. Though, of course, the acetate has all gone into holes. But such a lovely white bandolier--though I must say your green morocco is even lovelier. Not that it did me much good, that bandolier.' Her tears began to flow again. 'I suppose John told you. What I had to suffer--and not a gramme of soma to be had. Only a drink of mescal every now and then, when Popé used to bring it. Popé is a boy I used to know. But it makes you feel so bad afterwards, the mescal does, and you're sick with the peyotl; besides, it always made that awful feeling of being ashamed much worse the next day. And I was so ashamed. Just think of it: me, a Beta--having a baby, put yourself in my place.' (The mere suggestion made Lenina shudder.) 'Though it wasn't my fault, I swear; because I still don't know how it happened, seeing that I did all the Malthusian drill--you know, by numbers, One, two, three, four, always, I swear it; but all the same it happened; and of course there wasn't anything like an Abortion Centre here. Is it still down in Chelsea, by the way?' she asked. Lenina nodded. 'And still flood-lighted on Tuesdays and Fridays?' Lenina nodded again. 'That lovely pink glass tower!' Poor Linda lifted her face and with closed eyes ecstatically contemplated the bright remembered image. 'And the river at night,' she whispered. Great tears oozed slowly out from between her tight-shut eyelids. 'And flying back in the evening from Stoke Poges. And then a hot bath and vibro-vacuum massage... But there.' She drew a deep breath, shook her head, opened her eyes again, sniffed once or twice, then blew her nose on her fingers and wiped them on the skirt of her tunic. 'Oh, I'm so sorry,' she said in response to Lenina's involuntary grimace of disgust. 'I oughtn't to have done that. I'm sorry. But what are you to do when there aren't any handkerchiefs? I remember how it used to upset me, all that dirt, and nothing being aseptic. I had an awful cut on my head when they first brought me here. You can't imagine what they used to put on it. Filth, just filth. "Civilization is Sterilization," I used to say to them. And "Streptocock-Gee to Banbury-T, to see a fine bathroom and W.C." as though they were children. But of course they didn't understand. How should they? And in the end I suppose I got used to it. And anyhow, how can you keep things clean when there isn't hot water laid on? And look at these clothes. This beastly wool isn't like acetate. It lasts and lasts. And you're supposed to mend it if it gets torn. But I'm a Beta; I worked in the Fertilizing Room; nobody ever taught me to do anything like that. It wasn't my business. Besides, it never used to be right to mend clothes. Throw them away when they've got holes in them and buy new. "The more stitches, the less riches." Isn't that right? Mending's anti-social. But it's all different here. It's like living with lunatics. Everything they do is mad.' She looked round; saw John and Bernard had left them and were walking up and down in the dust and garbage outside the house; but, none the less confidentially lowering her voice, and leaning, while Lenina stiffened and shrank, so close that the blown reek of embryo-poison stirred the hair on her cheek. 'For instance,' she hoarsely whispered, 'take the way they have one another here. Mad, I tell you, absolutely mad. Everybody belongs to every one else--don't they? don't they?' she insisted, tugging at Lenina's sleeve. Lenina nodded her averted head, let out the breath she had been holding and managed to draw another one, relatively untainted. 'Well, here,' the other went on, 'nobody's supposed to belong to more than one person. And if you have people in the ordinary way, the others think you're wicked and anti-social. They hate and despise you. Once a lot of women came and made a scene because their men came to see me. Well, why not? And then they rushed at me... No, it was too awful. I can't tell you about it.' Linda covered her face with her hands and shuddered. 'They're so hateful, the women here. Mad, mad and cruel. And of course they don't know anything about Malthusian drill, or bottles, or decanting, or anything of that sort. So they're having children all the time--like dogs. It's too revolting. And to think that I... Oh, Ford, Ford, Ford! And yet John was a great comfort to me. I don't know what I should have done without him. Even though he did get so upset whenever a man... Quite as a tiny boy, even. Once (but that was when he was bigger) he tried to kill poor Waihusiwa--or was it Popé?--just because I used to have them sometimes. Because I never could make him understand that that was what civilized people ought to do. Being mad's infectious, I believe. Anyhow, John seems to have caught it from the Indians. Because, of course, he was with them a lot. Even though they always were so beastly to him and wouldn't let him do all the things the other boys did. Which was a good thing in a way, because it made it easier for me to condition him a little. Though you've no idea how difficult that is. There's so much one doesn't know; it wasn't my business to know. I mean, when a child asks you how a helicopter works or who made the world--well, what are you to answer if you're a Beta and have always worked in the Fertilizing Room? What are you to answer?'


Chapter VIII

Outside, in the dust and among the garbage (there were four dogs now), Bernard and John were walking slowly up and down.

'So hard for me to realize,' Bernard was saying, 'to reconstruct. As though we were living on different planets, in different centuries. A mother, and all this dirt, and gods, and old age, and disease...' He shook his head. 'It's almost inconceivable. I shall never understand unless you explain.'

'Explain what?'

'This.' He indicated the pueblo. 'That.' And it was the little house outside the village. 'Everything. All your life.'

'But what is there to say?'

'From the beginning. As far back as you can remember.'

'As far back as I can remember.' John frowned. There was a long silence.

****
It was very hot. They had eaten a lot of tortillas and sweet corn. Linda said, 'Come and lie down, Baby.' They lay down together in the big bed. 'Sing,' and Linda sang. Sang 'Streptocock-Gee to Banbury-T' and 'Bye, Baby Banting, soon you'll need decanting.' Her voice got fainter and fainter...

There was a loud noise, and he woke with a start. A man was standing by the bed, enormous, frightening. He was saying something to Linda, and Linda was laughing. She had pulled the blanket up to her chin, but the man pulled it down again. His hair was like two black ropes, and round his arm was a lovely silver bracelet with blue stones in it. He liked the bracelet; but all the same, he was frightened; he hid his face against Linda's body. Linda put her hand on him and he felt safer. In those other words he did not understand so well, she said to the man, 'Not with John here.' The man looked at him, then again at Linda, and said a few words in a soft voice. Linda said, 'No.' But the man bent over the bed towards him and his face was huge, terrible; the black ropes of hair touched the blanket. 'No,' Linda said again, and he felt her hand squeezing him more tightly. 'No, no!' But the man took hold of one of his arms, and it hurt. He screamed. The man put out his other hand and lifted him up. Linda was still holding him, still saying 'No, no.' The man said something short and angry, and suddenly her hands were gone. 'Linda, Linda.' He kicked and wriggled; but the man carried him across to the door, opened it, put him down on the floor in the middle of the other room, and went away, shutting the door behind him. He got up, he ran to the door. Standing on tiptoe he could just reach the big wooden latch. He lifted it and pushed; but the door wouldn't open. 'Linda,' he shouted. She didn't answer.

****
He remembered a huge room, rather dark; and there were big wooden things with strings fastened to them, and lots of women standing round them--making blankets, Linda said. Linda told him to sit in the corner with the other children, while she went and helped the women. He played with the little boys for a long time. Suddenly people started talking very loud, and there were the women pushing Linda away, and Linda was crying. She went to the door and he ran after her. He asked her why they were angry. 'Because I broke something,' she said. And then she got angry too. 'How should I know how to do their beastly weaving?' she said. 'Beastly savages.' He asked her what savages were. When they got back to their house, Popé was waiting at the door, and he came in with them. He had a big gourd full of stuff that looked like water; only it wasn't water, but something with a bad smell that burnt your mouth and made you cough. Linda drank some and Popé drank some, and then Linda laughed a lot and talked very loud; and then she and Popé went into the other room. When Popé went away, he went into the room. Linda was in bed and so fast asleep that he couldn't wake her.

Popé used to come often. He said the stuff in the gourd was called mescal; but Linda said it ought to be called soma; only it made you feel ill afterwards. He hated Popé. He hated them all--all the men who came to see Linda. One afternoon, when he had been playing with the other children--it was cold, he remembered, and there was snow on the mountains--he came back to the house and heard angry voices in the bedroom. They were women's voices, and they said words he didn't understand; but he knew they were dreadful words. Then suddenly, crash! something was upset; he heard people moving about quickly, and there was another crash and then a noise like hitting a mule, only not so bony; then Linda screamed. 'Oh, don't, don't, don't!' she said. He ran in. There were three women in dark blankets. Linda was on the bed. One of the women was holding her wrists. Another was lying across her legs, so that she couldn't kick. The third was hitting her with a whip. Once, twice, three times; and each time Linda screamed. Crying, he tugged at the fringe of the woman's blanket. 'Please, please.' With her free hand she held him away. The whip came down again, and again Linda screamed. He caught hold of the woman's enormous brown hand between his own and bit it with all his might. She cried out, wrenched her hand free, and gave him such a push that he fell down. While he was lying on the ground she hit him three times with the whip. It hurt more than anything he had ever felt--like fire. The whip whistled again, fell. But this time it was Linda who screamed.

'But why did they want to hurt you, Linda?' he asked that night. He was crying, because the red marks of the whip on his back still hurt so terribly. But he was also crying because people were so beastly and unfair, and because he was only a little boy and couldn't do anything against them. Linda was crying too. She was grown up, but she wasn't big enough to fight against three of them. It wasn't fair for her either. 'Why did they want to hurt you, Linda?'

'I don't know. How should I know?' It was difficult to hear what she said, because she was lying on her stomach and her face was in the pillow. 'They say those men are their men,' she went on; and she did not seem to be talking to him at all; she seemed to be talking with some one inside herself. A long talk which he didn't understand; and in the end she started crying louder than ever.

'Oh, don't cry, Linda. Don't cry.'

He pressed himself against her. He put his arm round her neck. Linda cried out. 'Oh, be careful. My shoulder! Oh!' and she pushed him away, hard. His head banged against the wall. 'Little idiot!' she shouted; and then, suddenly, she began to slap him. Slap, slap...

'Linda,' he cried out. 'Oh, mother, don't!'

'I'm not your mother. I won't be your mother.'

'But, Linda... Oh!' She slapped him on the cheek.

'Turned into a savage,' she shouted. 'Having young ones like an animal.... If it hadn't been for you, I might have gone to the Inspector, I might have got away. But not with a baby. That would have been too shameful.'

He saw that she was going to hit him again, and lifted his arm to guard his face. 'Oh don't, Linda, please don't.'

'Little beast!' She pulled down his arm; his face was uncovered.

'Don't, Linda.' He shut his eyes, expecting the blow.

But she didn't hit him. After a little time, he opened his eyes again and saw that she was looking at him. He tried to smile at her. Suddenly she put her arms round him and kissed him again and again.

****
Sometimes, for several days, Linda didn't get up at all. She lay in bed and was sad. Or else she drank the stuff that Popé brought and laughed a great deal and went to sleep. Sometimes she was sick. Often she forgot to wash him, and there was nothing to eat except cold tortillas. He remembered the first time she found those little animals in his hair, how she screamed and screamed.

****
The happiest times were when she told him about the Other Place. 'And you really can go flying, whenever you like?'

'Whenever you like.' And she would tell him about the lovely music that came out of a box, and all the nice games you could play, and the delicious things to eat and drink, and the light that came when you pressed a little thing in the wall, and the pictures that you could hear and feel and smell, as well as see, and another box for making nice smells, and the pink and green and blue and silver houses as high as mountains, and everybody happy and no one ever sad or angry, and every one belonging to every one else, and the boxes where you could see and hear what was happening at the other side of the world, and babies in lovely clean bottles--everything so clean, and no nasty smells, no dirt at all--and people never lonely, but living together and being so jolly and happy, like the summer dances here in Malpais, but much happier, and the happiness being there every day, every day.... He listened by the hour. And sometimes, when he and the other children were tired with too much playing, one of the old men of the pueblo would talk to them, in those other words, of the great Transformer of the World, and of the long fight between Right Hand and Left Hand, between Wet and Dry; of Awonawilona, who made a great fog by thinking in the night, and then made the whole world out of the fog; of Earth Mother and Sky Father; of Ahaiyuta and Marsailema, the twins of War and Chance; of Jesus and Pookong; of Mary and Etsanatlehi, the woman who makes herself young again; of the Black Stone at Laguna and the Great Eagle and Our Lady of Acoma. Strange stories, all the more wonderful to him for being told in the other words and so not fully understood. Lying in bed, he would think of Heaven and London and Our Lady of Acoma and the rows and rows of babies in clean bottles and Jesus flying up and Linda flying up and the great Director of World Hatcheries and Awonawilona.

****
Lots of men came to see Linda. The boys began to point their fingers at him. In the strange other words they said that Linda was bad; they called her names he did not understand, but that he knew were bad names. One day they sang a song about her, again and again. He threw stones at them. They threw back; a sharp stone cut his cheek. The blood wouldn't stop; he was covered with blood.

****
Linda taught him to read. With a piece of charcoal she drew pictures on the wall--an animal sitting down, a baby inside a bottle; then she wrote letters. THE CAT IS ON THE MAT. THE TOT IS IN THE POT. He learned quickly and easily. When he knew how to read all the words she wrote on the wall, Linda opened her big wooden box and pulled out from under those funny little red trousers she never wore a thin little book. He had often seen it before. 'When you're bigger,' she had said, 'you can read it.' Well, now he was big enough. He was proud. 'I'm afraid you won't find it very exciting,' she said. 'But it's the only thing I have.' She sighed. 'If only you could see the lovely reading machines we used to have in London!' He began reading. The Chemical and Bacteriological Conditioning of the Embryo. Practical Instructions for Beta Embryo-Store Workers. It took him a quarter of an hour to read the title alone. He threw the book on the floor. 'Beastly, beastly book!' he said, and began to cry.

****
The boys still sang their horrible song about Linda. Sometimes, too, they laughed at him for being so ragged. When he tore his clothes, Linda did not know how to mend them. In the Other Place, she told him, people threw away clothes with holes in them and got new ones. 'Rags, rags!' the boys used to shout at him. 'But I can read,' he said to himself, 'and they can't. They don't even know what reading is.' It was fairly easy, if he thought hard enough about the reading, to pretend that he didn't mind when they made fun of him. He asked Linda to give him the book again.

The more the boys pointed and sang, the harder he read. Soon he could read all the words quite well. Even the longest. But what did they mean? He asked Linda; but even when she could answer it didn't seem to make it very clear. And generally she couldn't answer at all.

'What are chemicals?' he would ask.

'Oh, stuff like magnesium salts, and alcohol for keeping the Deltas and Epsilons small and backward, and calcium carbonate for bones, and all that sort of thing.'

'But how do you make chemicals, Linda? Where do they come from?'

'Well, I don't know. You get them out of bottles. And when the bottles are empty, you send up to the Chemical Store for more. It's the Chemical Store people who make them, I suppose. Or else they send to the factory for them. I don't know. I never did any chemistry. My job was always with the embryos.'

It was the same with everything else he asked about. Linda never seemed to know. The old men of the pueblo had much more definite answers.

'The seed of men and all creatures, the seed of the sun and the seed of earth and the seed of the sky--Awonawilona made them all out of the Fog of Increase. Now the world has four wombs; and he laid the seeds in the lowest of the four wombs. And gradually the seeds began to grow...'

****
One day (John calculated later that it must have been soon after his twelfth birthday) he came home and found a book that he had never seen before lying on the floor in the bedroom. It was a thick book and looked very old. The binding had been eaten by mice; some of its pages were loose and crumpled. He picked it up, looked at the title-page: the book was called The Complete Works of William Shakespeare.

Linda was lying on the bed, sipping that horrible stinking mescal out of a cup. 'Popé brought it,' she said. Her voice was thick and hoarse like somebody else's voice. 'It was lying in one of the chests of the Antelope Kiva. It's supposed to have been there for hundreds of years. I expect it's true, because I looked at it, and it seemed to be full of nonsense. Uncivilized. Still, it'll be good enough for you to practise your reading on.' She took a last sip, set the cup down on the floor beside the bed, turned over on her side, hiccoughed once or twice and went to sleep.

He opened the book at random.

          Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty...
The strange words rolled through his mind; rumbled, like talking thunder; like the drums at the summer dances, if the drums could have spoken; like the men singing the Corn Song, beautiful, beautiful, so that you cried; like old Mitsima saying magic over his feathers and his carved sticks and his bits of bone and stone--kiathla tsilu silokwe silokwe silokwe. Kiai silu silu, tsithl--but better than Mitsima's magic, because it meant more, because it talked to him; talked wonderfully and only half-understandably, a terrible beautiful magic, about Linda; about Linda lying there snoring, with the empty cup on the floor beside the bed; about Linda and Popé, Linda and Popé.

****
He hated Popé more and more. A man can smile and smile and be a villain. Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain. What did the words exactly mean? He only half knew. But their magic was strong and went on rumbling in his head, and somehow it was as though he had never really hated Popé before; never really hated him because he had never been able to say how much he hated him. But now he had these words, these words like drums and singing and magic. These words and the strange, strange story out of which they were taken (he couldn't make head or tail of it, but it was wonderful, wonderful all the same)--they gave him a reason for hating Popé; and they made his hatred more real; they even made Popé himself more real.

One day, when he came in from playing, the door of the inner room was open, and he saw them lying together on the bed, asleep--white Linda and Popé almost black beside her, with one arm under her shoulders and the other dark hand on her breast, and one of the plaits of his long hair lying across her throat, like a black snake trying to strangle her. Popé's gourd and a cup were standing on the floor near the bed. Linda was snoring.

His heart seemed to have disappeared and left a hole. He was empty. Empty, and cold, and rather sick, and giddy. He leaned against the wall to steady himself. Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous... Like drums, like the men singing for the corn, like magic, the words repeated and repeated themselves in his head. From being cold he was suddenly hot. His cheeks burnt with the rush of blood, the room swam and darkened before his eyes. He ground his teeth. 'I'll kill him, I'll kill him, I'll kill him,' he kept saying. And suddenly there were more words.

When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed...
The magic was on his side, the magic explained and gave orders. He stepped back into the outer room. 'When he is drunk asleep...' The knife for the meat was lying on the floor near the fireplace. He picked it up and tiptoed to the door again. 'When he is drunk asleep, drunk asleep...' He ran across the room and stabbed--oh, the blood!--stabbed again, as Popé heaved out of his sleep, lifted his hand to stab once more, but found his wrist caught, held and--oh, oh!--twisted. He couldn't move, he was trapped, and there were Popé's small black eyes, very close, staring into his own. He looked away. There were two cuts on Popé's left shoulder. 'Oh, look at the blood!' Linda was crying. 'Look at the blood!' She had never been able to bear the sight of blood. Popé lifted his other hand--to strike him, he thought. He stiffened to receive the blow. But the hand only took him under the chin and turned his face, so that he had to look again into Popé's eyes. For a long time, for hours and hours. And suddenly--he couldn't help it--he began to cry. Popé burst out laughing. 'Go,' he said, in the other Indian words. 'Go, my brave Ahaiyuta.' He ran out into the other room to hide his tears.

****
'You are fifteen,' said old Mitsima, in the Indian words. 'Now I may teach you to work the clay.'

Squatting by the river, they worked together.

'First of all,' said Mitsima, taking a lump of the wetted clay between his hands, 'we make a little moon.' The old man squeezed the lump into a disk, then bent up the edges; the moon became a shallow cup.

Slowly and unskilfully he imitated the old man's delicate gestures.

'A moon, a cup, and now a snake.' Mitsima rolled out another piece of clay into a long flexible cylinder, hooped it into a circle and pressed it on to the rim of the cup. 'Then another snake. And another. And another.' Round by round, Mitsima built up the sides of the pot; it was narrow, it bulged, it narrowed again towards the neck. Mitsima squeezed and patted, stroked and scraped; and there at last it stood, in shape the familiar water-pot of Malpais, but creamy white instead of black, and still soft to the touch. The crooked parody of Mitsima's, his own stood beside it. Looking at the two pots, he had to laugh.

'But the next one will be better,' he said, and began to moisten another piece of clay.

To fashion, to give form, to feel his fingers gaining in skill and power--this gave him an extraordinary pleasure. 'A, B, C, Vitamin D,' he sang to himself as he worked, 'The fat's in the liver, the cod's in the sea.' And Mitsima also sang--a song about killing a bear. They worked all day, and all day he was filled with an intense, absorbing happiness.

'Next winter,' said old Mitsima, 'I will teach you to make the bow.'

****
He stood for a long time outside the house; and at last the ceremonies within were finished. The door opened; they came out. Kothlu came first, his right hand outstretched and tightly closed, as though over some precious jewel. Her clenched hand similarly outstretched, Kiakimé followed. They walked in silence, and in silence, behind them, came the brothers and sisters and cousins and all the troop of old people.

They walked out of the pueblo, across the mesa. At the edge of the cliff they halted, facing the early morning sun. Kothlu opened his hand. A pinch of corn meal lay white on the palm; he breathed on it, murmured a few words, then threw it, a handful of white dust, towards the sun. Kiakimé did the same. Then Kiakimé's father stepped forward, and holding up a feathered prayer stick, made a long prayer, then threw the stick after the corn meal.

'It is finished,' said old Mitsima in a loud voice. 'They are married.'

'Well,' said Linda, as they turned away, 'all I can say is, it does seem a lot of fuss to make about so little. In civilized countries, when a boy wants to have a girl, he just... But where are you going, John?'

He paid no attention to her calling, but ran on, away, away, anywhere to be by himself.

It is finished. Old Mitsima's words repeated themselves in his mind. Finished, finished... In silence and from a long way off, but violently, desperately, hopelessly, he had loved Kiakimé. And now it was finished. He was sixteen.

****
At the full moon, in the Antelope Kiva, secrets would be told, secrets would be done and borne. They would go down, boys, into the kiva and come out again, men. The boys were all afraid and at the same time impatient. And at last it was the day. The sun went down, the moon rose. He went with the others. Men were standing, dark, at the entrance to the kiva; the ladder went down into the red lighted depths. Already the leading boys had begun to climb down. Suddenly one of the men stepped forward, caught him by the arm, and pulled him out of the ranks. He broke free and dodged back into his place among the others. This time the man struck him, pulled his hair. 'Not for you, white-hair!' 'Not for the son of the she-dog,' said one of the other men. The boys laughed. 'Go!' And as he still hovered on the fringes of the group, 'Go!' the men shouted again. One of them bent down, took a stone, threw it. 'Go, go, go!' There was a shower of stones. Bleeding, he ran away into the darkness. From the red-lit kiva came the noise of singing. The last of the boys had climbed down the ladder. He was all alone.

All alone, outside the pueblo, on the bare plain of the mesa. The rock was like bleached bones in the moonlight. Down in the valley, the coyotes were howling at the moon. The bruises hurt him, the cuts were still bleeding; but it was not for pain that he sobbed; it was because he was all alone, because he had been driven out, alone, into this skeleton world of rocks and moonlight. At the edge of the precipice he sat down. The moon was behind him; he looked down into the black shadow of the mesa, into the black shadow of death. He had only to take one step, one little jump.... He held out his right hand in the moonlight. From the cut on his wrist the blood was still oozing. Every few seconds a drop fell, dark, almost colourless in the dead light. Drop, drop, drop. To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow...

He had discovered Time and Death and God.

'Alone, always alone,' the young man was saying.

The words awoke a plaintive echo in Bernard's mind. Alone, alone... 'So am I,' he said, on a gush of confidingness. 'Terribly alone.'

'Are you?' John looked surprised. 'I thought that in the Other Place... I mean, Linda always said that nobody was ever alone there.'

Bernard blushed uncomfortably. 'You see,' he said, mumbling and with averted eyes, 'I'm rather different from most people, I suppose. If one happens to be decanted different...'

'Yes, that's just it.' The young man nodded. 'If one's different, one's bound to be lonely. They're beastly to one. Do you know, they shut me out of absolutely everything? When the other boys were sent out to spend the night on the mountains--you know, when you have to dream which your sacred animal is--they wouldn't let me go with the others; they wouldn't tell me any of the secrets. I did it by myself, though,' he added. 'Didn't eat anything for five days and then went out one night alone into those mountains there.' He pointed.

Patronizingly, Bernard smiled. 'And did you dream of anything?' he asked.

The other nodded. 'But I mustn't tell you what.' He was silent for a little; then, in a low voice, 'Once,' he went on, 'I did something that none of the others did: I stood against a rock in the middle of the day, in summer, with my arms out, like Jesus on the cross.'

'What on earth for?'

'I wanted to know what it was like being crucified. Hanging there in the sun...'

'But why?'

'Why? Well...' He hesitated. 'Because I felt I ought to. If Jesus could stand it. And then, if one has done something wrong... Besides, I was unhappy; that was another reason.'

'It seems a funny way of curing your unhappiness,' said Bernard. But on second thoughts he decided that there was, after all, some sense in it. Better than taking soma....

'I fainted after a time,' said the young man. 'Fell down on my face. Do you see the mark where I cut myself?' He lifted the thick yellow hair from his forehead. The scar showed, pale and puckered, on his right temple.

Bernard looked, and then quickly, with a little shudder, averted his eyes. His conditioning had made him not so much pitiful as profoundly squeamish. The mere suggestion of illness or wounds was to him not only horrifying, but even repulsive and rather disgusting. Like dirt, or deformity, or old age. Hastily he changed the subject.

'I wonder if you'd like to come back to London with us?' he asked, making the first move in a campaign whose strategy he had been secretly elaborating ever since, in the little house, he had realized who the 'father' of this young savage must be. 'Would you like that?'

The young man's face lit up. 'Do you really mean it?'

'Of course; if I can get permission, that is.'

'Linda too?'

'Well...' He hesitated doubtfully. That revolting creature! No, it was impossible. Unless, unless... It suddenly occurred to Bernard that her very revoltingness might prove an enormous asset. 'But of course!' he cried, making up for his first hesitations with an excess of noisy cordiality.

The young man drew a deep breath. 'To think it should be coming true--what I've dreamt of all my life. Do you remember what Miranda says?'

'Who's Miranda?'

But the young man had evidently not heard the question. 'O wonder!' he was saying; and his eyes shone, his face was brightly flushed. 'How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is!' The flush suddenly deepened; he was thinking of Lenina, of an angel in bottle-green viscose, lustrous with youth and skin food, plump, benevolently smiling. His voice faltered. 'O brave new world,' he began, then suddenly interrupted himself; the blood had left his cheeks; he was as pale as paper. 'Are you married to her?' he asked.

'Am I what?'

'Married. You know--for ever. They say "for ever" in the Indian words; it can't be broken.'

'Ford, no!' Bernard couldn't help laughing.

John also laughed, but for another reason--laughed for pure joy.

'O brave new world,' he repeated. 'O brave new world that has such people in it. Let's start at once.'

'You have a most peculiar way of talking sometimes,' said Bernard, staring at the young man in perplexed astonishment. 'And, anyhow, hadn't you better wait till you actually see the new world?'


Chapter IX

Lenina felt herself entitled, after this day of queerness and horror, to a complete and absolute holiday. As soon as they got back to the rest-house, she swallowed six half-gramme tablets of soma, lay down on her bed, and within ten minutes had embarked for lunar eternity. It would be eighteen hours at the least before she was in time again.

Bernard meanwhile lay pensive and wide-eyed in the dark. It was long after midnight before he fell asleep. Long after midnight; but his insomnia had not been fruitless; he had a plan.

Punctually, on the following morning, at ten o'clock, the green-uniformed octoroon stepped out of his helicopter. Bernard was waiting for him among the agaves.

'Miss Crowne's gone on soma-holiday,' he explained. 'Can hardly be back before five. Which leaves us seven hours.'

He could fly to Santa Fé, do all the business he had to do, and be in Malpais again long before she woke up.

'She'll be quite safe here by herself?'

'Safe as helicopters,' the octoroon assured him.

They climbed into the machine and started off at once. At ten thirty-four they landed on the roof of the Santa Fé Post Office; at ten thirty-seven Bernard had got through to the World Controller's Office in Whitehall; at ten thirty-nine he was speaking to his fordship's fourth personal secretary; at ten forty-four he was repeating his story to the first secretary, and at ten forty-seven and a half it was the deep, resonant voice of Mustapha Mond himself that sounded in his ears.

'I ventured to think,' stammered Bernard, 'that your fordship might find the matter of sufficient scientific interest...'

'Yes, I do find it of sufficient scientific interest,' said the deep voice. 'Bring these two individuals back to London with you.'

'Your fordship is aware that I shall need a special permit...'

'The necessary orders,' said Mustapha Mond, 'are being sent to the Warden of the Reservation at this moment. You will proceed at once to the Warden's Office. Good-morning, Mr. Marx.'

There was silence. Bernard hung up the receiver and hurried up to the roof.

'Warden's Office,' he said to the Gamma-green octoroon.

At ten fifty-four Bernard was shaking hands with the Warden.

'Delighted, Mr. Marx, delighted.' His boom was deferential. 'We have just received special orders...'

'I know,' said Bernard, interrupting him. 'I was talking to his fordship on the phone a moment ago.' His bored tone implied that he was in the habit of talking to his fordship every day of the week. He dropped into a chair. 'If you'll kindly take all the necessary steps as soon as possible. As soon as possible,' he emphatically repeated. He was thoroughly enjoying himself.

At eleven three he had all the necessary papers in his pocket.

'So long,' he said patronizingly to the Warden, who had accompanied him as far as the lift gates. 'So long.'

He walked across to the hotel, had a bath, a vibro-vac massage, and an electrolytic shave, listened in to the morning's news, looked in for half an hour on the televisor, ate a leisured luncheon, and at half-past two flew back with the octoroon to Malpais.

****
The young man stood outside the rest-house.

'Bernard,' he called. 'Bernard!' There was no answer.

Noiseless on his deerskin moccasins, he ran up the steps and tried the door. The door was locked.

They were gone! Gone! It was the most terrible thing that had ever happened to him. She had asked him to come and see them, and now they were gone. He sat down on the steps and cried.

Half an hour later it occurred to him to look through the window. The first thing he saw was a green suit-case, with the initials L. C. painted on the lid. Joy flared up like fire within him. He picked up a stone. The smashed glass tinkled on the floor. A moment later he was inside the room. He opened the green suit-case; and all at once he was breathing Lenina's perfume, filling his lungs with her essential being. His heart beat wildly; for a moment he was almost faint. Then, bending over the precious box, he touched, he lifted into the light, he examined. The zippers on Lenina's spare pair of viscose velveteen shorts were at first a puzzle, then, solved, a delight. Zip, and then zip; zip, and then zip; he was enchanted. Her green slippers were the most beautiful things he had ever seen. He unfolded a pair of zippicamiknicks, blushed, put them hastily away again; but kissed a perfumed acetate handkerchief and wound a scarf round his neck. Opening a box, he spilt a cloud of scented powder. His hands were floury with the stuff. He wiped them on his chest, on his shoulders, on his bare arms. Delicious perfume! He shut his eyes; he rubbed his cheek against his own powdered arm. Touch of smooth skin against his face, scent in his nostrils of musky dust--her real presence. 'Lenina,' he whispered. 'Lenina!'

A noise made him start, made him guiltily turn. He crammed up his thieveries into the suit-case and shut the lid; then listened again, looked. Not a sign of life, not a sound. And yet he had certainly heard something--something like a sigh, something like the creak of a board. He tiptoed to the door and, cautiously opening it, found himself looking on to a broad landing. On the opposite side of the landing was another door, ajar. He stepped out, pushed, peeped.

There, on a low bed, the sheet flung back, dressed in a pair of pink one-piece zippyjamas, lay Lenina, fast asleep and so beautiful in the midst of her curls, so touchingly childish with her pink toes and her grave sleeping face, so trustful in the helplessness of her limp hands and melted limbs, that the tears came to his eyes.

With an infinity of quite unnecessary precautions--for nothing short of a pisto-shot could have called Lenina back from her soma-holiday before the appointed time--he entered the room, he knelt on the floor beside the bed. He gazed, he clasped his hands, his lips moved. 'Her eyes,' he murmured,

'Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice;
Handlest in thy discourse, O! that her hand,
In whose comparison all whites are ink
Writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure
The cygnet's down is harsh...'
A fly buzzed round her; he waved it away. 'Flies,' he remembered,

'On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand, may seize
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.'
Very slowly, with the hesitating gesture of one who reaches forward to stroke a shy and possibly rather dangerous bird, he put out his hand. It hung there trembling, within an inch of those limp fingers, on the verge of contact. Did he dare? Dare to profane with his unworthiest hand that... No he didn't. The bird was too dangerous. His hand dropped back. How beautiful she was! How beautiful!

Then suddenly he found himself reflecting that he had only to take hold of the zipper at her neck and give one long, strong pull.... He shut his eyes, he shook his head with the gesture of a dog shaking its ears as it emerges from the water. Detestable thought! He was ashamed of himself. Pure and vestal modesty...

There was a humming in the air. Another fly trying to steal immortal blessings? A wasp? He looked, saw nothing. The humming grew louder and louder, localized itself as being outside the shuttered windows. The plane! In a panic, he scrambled to his feet and ran into the other room, vaulted through the open window, and hurrying along the path between the tall agaves was in time to receive Bernard Marx as he climbed out of the helicopter.


Chapter X

The hands of all the four thousand electric clocks in all the Bloomsbury Centre's four thousand rooms marked twenty-seven minutes past two. 'This hive of industry,' as the Director was fond of calling it, was in the full buzz of work. Every one was busy, everything in ordered motion. Under the microscopes, their long tails furiously lashing, spermatozoa were burrowing head first into eggs; and, fertilized, the eggs were expanding, dividing, or if bokanovskified, budding and breaking up into whole populations of separate embryos. From the Social Predestination Room the escalators went rumbling down into the basement, and there, in the crimson darkness, stewingly warm on their cushion of peritoneum and gorged with blood-surrogate and hormones, the foetuses grew and grew or, poisoned, languished into a stunted Epsilonhood. With a faint hum and rattle the moving racks crawled imperceptibly through the weeks and the recapitulated æons to where, in the Decanting Room, the newly-unbottled babes uttered their first yell of horror and amazement.

The dynamos purred in the sub-basement, the lifts rushed up and down. On all the eleven floors of Nurseries it was feeding time. From eighteen hundred bottles eighteen hundred carefully labelled infants were simultaneously sucking down their pint of pasteurized external secretion.

Above them, in ten successive layers of dormitory, the little boys and girls who were still young enough to need an afternoon sleep were as busy as every one else, though they did not know it, listening unconsciously to hypnopædic lessons in hygiene and sociability, in class-consciousness and the toddler's love-life. Above these again were the playrooms where, the weather having turned to rain, nine hundred older children were amusing themselves with bricks and clay modelling, hunt-the-zipper, and erotic play.

Buzz, buzz! the hive was humming, busily, joyfully. Blithe was the singing of the young girls over their test-tubes, the Predestinators whistled as they worked, and in the Decanting Room what glorious jokes were cracked above the empty bottles! But the Director's face, as he entered the Fertilizing Room with Henry Foster, was grave, wooden with severity.

'A public example,' he was saying. 'In this room, because it contains more high-caste workers than any other in the Centre. I have told him to meet me here at half-past two.'

'He does his work very well,' put in Henry, with hypocritical generosity.

'I know. But that's all the more reason for severity. His intellectual eminence carries with it corresponding moral responsibilities. The greater a man's talents, the greater his power to lead astray. It is better that one should suffer than that many should be corrupted. Consider the matter dispassionately, Mr. Foster, and you will see that no offence is so heinous as unorthodoxy of behaviour. Murder kills only the individual--and, after all, what is an individual?' With a sweeping gesture he indicated the rows of microscopes, the test-tubes, the incubators. 'We can make a new one with the greatest ease--as many as we like. Unorthodoxy threatens more than the life of a mere individual; it strikes at Society itself. Yes, at Society itself,' he repeated. 'Ah, but here he comes.'

Bernard had entered the room and was advancing between the rows of fertilizers towards them. A veneer of jaunty self-confidence thinly concealed his nervousness. The voice in which he said, 'Good-morning, Director,' was absurdly too loud; that in which, correcting his mistake, he said, 'You asked me to come and speak to you here,' ridiculously soft, a squeak.

'Yes, Mr. Marx,' said the Director portentously. 'I did ask you to come to me here. You returned from your holiday last night, I understand.'

'Yes,' Bernard answered.

'Yes-s,' repeated the Director, lingering, a serpent, on the 's.' Then, suddenly raising his voice, 'Ladies and gentlemen,' he trumpeted, 'ladies and gentlemen.'

The singing of the girls over their test-tubes, the preoccupied whistling of the Microscopists, suddenly ceased. There was a profound silence; every one looked round.

'Ladies and gentlemen,' the Director repeated once more, 'excuse me for thus interrupting your labours. A painful duty constrains me. The security and stability of Society are in danger. Yes, in danger, ladies and gentlemen. This man,' he pointed accusingly at Bernard, 'this man who stands before you here, this Alpha-Plus to whom so much has been given, and from whom, in consequence, so much must be expected, this colleague of yours--or should I anticipate and say this ex-colleague?--has grossly betrayed the trust imposed in him. By his heretical views on sport and soma, by the scandalous unorthodoxy of his sex-life, by his refusal to obey the teachings of Our Ford and behave out of office hours "like a babe in a bottle"' (here the Director made the sign of the T), 'he has proved himself an enemy of Society, a subverter, ladies and gentlemen, of all Order and Stability, a conspirator against Civilization itself. For this reason I propose to dismiss him, to dismiss him with ignominy from the post he has held in this Centre; I propose forthwith to apply for his transference to a Sub-Centre of the lowest order and, that his punishment may serve the best interest of Society, as far as possible removed from any important Centre of population. In Iceland he will have small opportunity to lead others astray by his unfordly example.' The Director paused; then, folding his arms, he turned impressively to Bernard. 'Marx,' he said, 'can you show any reason why I should not now execute the judgment passed upon you?'

'Yes, I can,' Bernard answered in a very loud voice.

Somewhat taken aback, but still majestically, 'Then show it,' said the Director.

'Certainly. But it's in the passage. One moment.' Bernard hurried to the door and threw it open. 'Come in,' he commanded, and the reason came in and showed itself.

There was a gasp, a murmur of astonishment and horror; a young girl screamed; standing on a chair to get a better view some one upset two test-tubes full of spermatozoa. Bloated, sagging, and among those firm youthful bodies, those undistorted faces, a strange and terrifying monster of middle-agedness, Linda advanced into the room, coquettishly smiling her broken and discoloured smile, and rolling as she walked, with what was meant to be a voluptuous undulation, her enormous haunches. Bernard walked beside her.

'There he is,' he said, pointing at the Director.

'Did you think I didn't recognize him?' Linda asked indignantly; then, turning to the Director, 'Of course I knew you; Tomakin, I should have known you anywhere, among a thousand. But perhaps you've forgotten me. Don't you remember? Don't you remember, Tomakin? Your Linda.' She stood looking at him, her head on one side, still smiling, but with a smile that became progressively, in face of the Director's expression of petrified disgust, less and less self-confident, that wavered and finally went out. 'Don't you remember, Tomakin?' she repeated in a voice that trembled. Her eyes were anxious, agonized. The blotched and sagging face twitched grotesquely into the grimace of extreme grief. 'Tomakin!' She held out her arms. Some one began to titter.

'What's the meaning,' began the Director, 'of this monstrous...'

'Tomakin!' She ran forward, her blanket trailing behind her, threw her arms round his neck, hid her face on his chest.

A howl of laughter went up irrepressibly.

'...this monstrous practical joke,' the Director shouted.

Red in the face, he tried to disengage himself from her embrace. Desperately she clung. 'But I'm Linda, I'm Linda.' The laughter drowned her voice. 'You made me have a baby,' she screamed above the uproar. There was a sudden and appalling hush; eyes floated uncomfortably, not knowing where to look. The Director went suddenly pale, stopped struggling and stood, his hands on her wrists, staring down at her, horrified. 'Yes, a baby--and I was its mother.' She flung the obscenity like a challenge into the outraged silence; then, suddenly breaking away from him, ashamed, ashamed, covered her face with her hands, sobbing. 'It wasn't my fault, Tomakin. Because I always did my drill, didn't I? Didn't I? Always... I don't know how... If you knew how awful, Tomakin... But he was a comfort to me, all the same.' Turning towards the door, 'John!' she called. 'John!'

He came in at once, paused for a moment just inside the door, looked round, then soft on his moccasined feet strode quickly across the room, fell on his knees in front of the Director, and said in a clear voice: 'My father!'

The word (for 'father' was not so much obscene as--with its connotation of something at one remove from the loathsomeness and moral obliquity of child-bearing--merely gross, a scatological rather than a pornographic impropriety), the comically smutty word relieved what had become a quite intolerable tension. Laughter broke out, enormous, almost hysterical, peal after peal, as though it would never stop. My father--and it was the Director! My father! Oh, Ford, oh Ford! That was really too good. The whooping and the roaring renewed themselves, faces seemed on the point of disintegration, tears were streaming. Six more test-tubes of spermatozoa were upset. My father!

Pale, wild-eyed, the Director glared about him in an agony of bewildered humiliation.

My father! The laughter, which had shown signs of dying away, broke out again more loudly than ever. He put his hands over his ears and rushed out of the room.


Chapter XI

After the scene in the Fertilizing Room, all upper-caste London was wild to see this delicious creature who had fallen on his knees before the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning--or rather the ex-Director, for the poor man had resigned immediately afterwards and never set foot inside the Centre again--had flopped down and called him (the joke was almost too good to be true!) 'my father.' Linda, on the contrary, cut no ice; nobody had the smallest desire to see Linda. To say one was a mother--that was past a joke: it was an obscenity. Moreover, she wasn't a real savage, had been hatched out of a bottle and conditioned like any one else: so couldn't have really quaint ideas. Finally--and this was by far the strongest reason for people's not wanting to see poor Linda--there was her appearance. Fat; having lost her youth; with bad teeth, and a blotched complexion, and that figure (Ford!)--you simply couldn't look at her without feeling sick, yes, positively sick. So the best people were quite determined not to see Linda. And Linda, for her part, had no desire to see them. The return to civilization was for her the return to soma, was the possibility of lying in bed and taking holiday after holiday, without ever having to come back to a headache or a fit of vomiting, without ever being made to feel as you always felt after peyotl, as though you'd done something so shamefully anti-social that you could never hold up your head again. Soma played none of these unpleasant tricks. The holiday it gave was perfect and, if the morning after was disagreeable, it was so, not intrinsically, but only by comparison with the joys of the holiday. The remedy was to make the holiday continuous. Greedily she clamoured for ever larger, ever more frequent doses. Dr. Shaw at first demurred; then let her have what she wanted. She took as much as twenty grammes a day.

'Which will finish her off in a month or two,' the doctor confided to Bernard. 'One day the respiratory centre will be paralysed. No more breathing. Finished. And a good thing too. If we could rejuvenate, of course it would be different. But we can't.'

Surprisingly, as every one thought (for on soma-holiday Linda was most conveniently out of the way), John raised objections.

'But aren't you shortening her life by giving her so much?'

'In one sense, yes,' Dr. Shaw admitted. 'But in another we're actually lengthening it.' The young man stared, uncomprehending. 'Soma may make you lose a few years in time,' the doctor went on. 'But think of the enormous, immeasurable durations it can give you out of time. Every soma-holiday is a bit of what our ancestors used to call eternity.'

John began to understand. 'Eternity was in our lips and eyes,' he murmured.

'Eh?'

'Nothing,'

'Of course,' Dr. Shaw went on, 'you can't allow people to go popping off into eternity if they've got any serious work to do. But as she hasn't got any serious work...'

'All the same,' John persisted, 'I don't believe it's right.'

The doctor shrugged his shoulders. 'Well, of course, if you prefer to have her screaming mad all the time...'

In the end John was forced to give in. Linda got her soma. Thenceforward she remained in her little room on the thirty-seventh floor of Bernard's apartment house, in bed, with the radio and television always on, and the patchouli tap just dripping, and the soma tablets within reach of her hand--there she remained; and yet wasn't there at all, was all the time away, infinitely far away, on holiday; on holiday in some other world, where the music of the radio was a labyrinth of sonorous colours, a sliding, palpitating labyrinth, that led (by what beautifully inevitable windings) to a bright centre of absolute conviction; where the dancing images of the television box were the performers in some indescribably delicious all-singing feely; where the dripping patchouli was more than scent--was the sun, was a million sexophones, was Popé making love, only much more so, incomparably more, and without end.

'No, we can't rejuvenate. But I'm very glad,' Dr. Shaw had concluded, 'to have had this opportunity to see an example of senility in a human being. Thank you so much for calling me in.' He shook Bernard warmly by the hand.

It was John, then, they were all after. And as it was only through Bernard, his accredited guardian, that John could be seen, Bernard now found himself, for the first time in his life, treated not merely normally, but as a person of outstanding importance. There was no more talk of the alcohol in his blood-surrogate, no gibes at his personal appearance. Henry Foster went out of his way to be friendly; Benito Hoover made him a present of six packets of sex-hormone chewing-gum; the Assistant Predestinator came and cadged almost abjectly for an invitation to one of Bernard's evening parties. As for the women, Bernard had only to hint at the possibility of an invitation, and he could have whichever of them he liked.

'Bernard's asked me to meet the Savage next Wednesday,' Fanny announced triumphantly.

'I'm so glad,' said Lenina. 'And now you must admit that you were wrong about Bernard. Don't you think he's really rather sweet?'

Fanny nodded. 'And I must say,' she said, 'I was quite agreeably surprised.'

The Chief Bottler, the Director of Predestination, three Deputy Assistant Fertilizer-Generals, the Professor of Feelies in the College of Emotional Engineering, the Dean of the Westminster Community Singery, the Supervisor of Bokanovskification--the list of Bernard's notabilities was interminable.

'And I had six girls last week,' he confided to Helmholtz Watson. 'One on Monday, two on Tuesday, two more on Friday, and one on Saturday. And if I'd had the time or the inclination, there were at least a dozen more who were only too anxious...'

Helmholtz listened to his boastings in a silence so gloomily disapproving that Bernard was offended.

'You're envious,' he said.

Helmholtz shook his head. 'I'm rather sad, that's all,' he answered.

Bernard went off in a huff. Never, he told himself, never would he speak to Helmholtz again.

The days passed. Success went fizzily to Bernard's head, and in the process completely reconciled him (as any good intoxicant should do) to a world which, up till then, he had found very unsatisfactory. In so far as it recognized him as important, the order of things was good. But, reconciled by his success, he yet refused to forgo the privilege of criticizing this order. For the act of criticizing heightened his sense of importance, made him feel larger. Moreover, he did genuinely believe that there were things to criticize. (At the same time, he genuinely liked being a success and having all the girls he wanted.) Before those who now, for the sake of the Savage, paid their court to him, Bernard would parade a carping unorthodoxy. He was politely listened to. But behind his back people shook their heads. 'That young man will come to a bad end,' they said, prophesying the more confidently in that they themselves would in due course personally see to it that the end was bad. 'He won't find another Savage to help him out a second time,' they said. Meanwhile, however, there was the first Savage; they were polite. And because they were polite, Bernard felt positively gigantic--gigantic and at the same time light with elation, lighter than air.

****
'Lighter than air,' said Bernard, pointing upwards.

Like a pearl in the sky, high, high above them, the Weather Department's captive balloon shone rosily in the sunshine.

'...the said Savage,' so ran Bernard's instructions, 'to be shown civilized life in all its aspects....'

He was being shown a bird's-eye view of it at present, a bird's-eye view from the platform of the Charing-T Tower. The Station Master and the Resident Meteorologist were acting as guides. But it was Bernard who did most of the talking. Intoxicated, he was behaving as though, at the very least, he were a visiting World Controller. Lighter than air.

The Bombay Green Rocket dropped out of the sky. The passengers alighted. Eight identical Dravidian twins in khaki looked out of the eight portholes of the cabin--the stewards.

'Twelve hundred and fifty kilometres an hour,' said the Station Master impressively. 'What do you think of that, Mr. Savage?'

John thought it very nice. 'Still,' he said, 'Ariel could put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes.'

****
'The Savage,' wrote Bernard in his report to Mustapha Mond, 'shows surprisingly little astonishment at, or awe of, civilized inventions. This is partly due, no doubt, to the fact that he has heard them talked about by the woman Linda, his m----.'

(Mustapha Mond frowned. 'Does the fool think I'm too squeamish to see the word written out at full length?')

'Partly on his interest being focussed on what he calls "the soul," which he persists as regarding as an entity independent of the physical environment; whereas, as I tried to point out to him...'

The Controller skipped the next sentences and was just about to turn the page in search of something more interestingly concrete, when his eye was caught by a series of quite extraordinary phrases. '...though I must admit,' he read, 'that I agree with the Savage in finding civilized infantility too easy or, as he puts it, not expensive enough; and I would like to take this opportunity of drawing your fordship's attention to...'

Mustapha Mond's anger gave place almost at once to mirth. The idea of this creature solemnly lecturing him--him--about the social order was really too grotesque. The man must have gone mad. 'I ought to give him a lesson,' he said to himself; then threw back his head and laughed aloud. For the moment, at any rate, the lesson would not be given.

It was a small factory of lighting-sets for helicopters, a branch of the Electrical Equipment Corporation. They were met on the roof itself (for that circular letter of recommendation from the Controller was magical in its effects) by the Chief Technician and the Human Element Manager. They walked downstairs into the factory.

'Each process,' explained the Human Element Manager, 'is carried out, so far as possible, by a single Bokanovsky Group.'

And, in effect, eighty-three almost noseless black brachycephalic Deltas were cold-pressing. The fifty-six four-spindle chucking and turning machines were being manipulated by fifty-six aquiline and ginger Gammas. One hundred and seven heat-conditioned Epsilon Senegalese were working in the foundry. Thirty-three Delta females, long-headed, sandy, with narrow pelvises, and all within 20 millimetres of 1 metre 69 centimetres tall, were cutting screws. In the assembling room, the dynamos were being put together by two sets of Gamma-Plus dwarfs. The two low work-tables faced one another; between them crawled the conveyor with its load of separate parts; forty-seven blond heads were confronted by forty-seven brown ones. Forty-seven snubs by forty-seven hooks; forty-seven receding by forty-seven prognathous chins. The completed mechanisms were inspected by eighteen identical curly auburn girls in Gamma green, packed in crates by thirty-four short-legged, left-handed male Delta-Minuses, and loaded into the waiting trucks and lorries by sixty-three blue-eyed, flaxen and freckled Epsilon Semi-Morons.

'O brave new world...' By some malice of his memory the Savage found himself repeating Miranda's words. 'O brave new world that has such people in it.'

'And I assure you,' the Human Element Manager concluded, as they left the factory, 'we hardly ever have any trouble with our workers. We always find...'

But the Savage had suddenly broken away from his companions and was violently retching, behind a clump of laurels, as though the solid earth had been a helicopter in an air pocket.

****
'The Savage,' wrote Bernard, 'refuses to take soma, and seems much distressed because the woman Linda, his m----, remains permanently on holiday. It is worthy of note that, in spite of his m----'s senility and the extreme repulsiveness of her appearance, the Savage frequently goes to see her and appears to be much attached to her--an interesting example of the way in which early conditioning can be made to modify and even run counter to natural impulses (in this case, the impulse to recoil from an unpleasant object).'

****
At Eton they alighted on the roof of Upper School. On the opposite side of School Yard, the fifty-two stories of Lupton's Tower gleamed white in the sunshine. College on their left and, on their right, the School Community Singery reared their venerable piles of ferro-concrete and vita-glass. In the centre of the quadrangle stood the quaint old chrome-steel statue of Our Ford.

Dr. Gaffney, the Provost, and Miss Keate, the Head Mistress, received them as they stepped out of the plane.

'Do you have many twins here?' the Savage asked rather apprehensively, as they set out on their tour of inspection.

'Oh no,' the Provost answered. 'Eton is reserved exclusively for upper-caste boys and girls. One egg, one adult. It makes education more difficult, of course. But as they'll be called upon to take responsibilities and deal with unexpected emergencies, it can't be helped.' He sighed.

Bernard, meanwhile, had taken a strong fancy to Miss Keate. 'If you're free any Monday, Wednesday, or Friday evening,' he was saying. Jerking his thumb towards the Savage, 'He's curious, you know,' Bernard added. 'Quaint.'

Miss Keate smiled (and her smile was really charming, he thought); said Thank you; would be delighted to come to one of his parties. The Provost opened a door.

Five minutes in that Alpha-Double-Plus classroom left John a trifle bewildered.

'What is elementary relativity?' he whispered to Bernard. Bernard tried to explain, then thought better of it and suggested that they should go to some other classroom.

From behind a door in the corridor leading to the Beta-Minus geography room, a ringing soprano voice called, 'One, two, three, four,' and then, with a weary impatience, 'As you were.'

'Malthusian Drill,' explained the Head Mistress. 'Most of our girls are freemartins, of course. I'm a freemartin myself.' She smiled at Bernard. 'But we have about eight hundred unsterilized ones who need constant drilling.'

In the Beta-Minus geography room John learnt that 'a savage reservation is a place which, owing to unfavourable climatic or geological conditions, or poverty of natural resources, has not been worth the expense of civilizing.' A click; the room was darkened; and suddenly, on the screen above the Master's head, there were the Penitentes of Acoma prostrating themselves before Our Lady, and wailing as John had heard them wail, confessing their sins before Jesus on the cross, before the eagle image of Pookong. The young Etonians fairly shouted with laughter. Still wailing, the Penitentes rose to their feet, stripped off their upper garments and, with knotted whips, began to beat themselves, blow after blow. Redoubled, the laughter drowned even the amplified record of their groans.

'But why do they laugh?' asked the Savage in a pained bewilderment.

'Why?' The Provost turned towards him a still broadly grinning face. 'Why? But because it's so extraordinarily funny.'

In the cinematographic twilight, Bernard risked a gesture which, in the past, even total darkness would hardly have emboldened him to make. Strong in his new importance, he put his arm round the Head Mistress's waist. It yielded, willowily. He was just about to snatch a kiss or two and perhaps a gentle pinch, when the shutters clicked open again.

'Perhaps we had better go on,' said Miss Keate, and moved towards the door.

'And this,' said the Provost a moment later, 'is the Hypnopædic Control Room.'

Hundreds of synthetic music boxes, one for each dormitory, stood ranged in shelves round three sides of the room; pigeon-holed on the fourth were the paper sound-track rolls on which the various hypnopædic lessons were printed.

'You slip the roll in here,' explained Bernard, interrupting Dr. Gaffney, 'press down this switch...'

'No, that one,' corrected the Provost, annoyed.

'That one, then. The roll unwinds. The selenium cells transform the light impulses into sound waves, and...'

'And there you are,' Dr. Gaffney concluded.

'Do they read Shakespeare?' asked the Savage as they walked, on their way to the Bio-chemical Laboratories, past the School Library.

'Certainly not,' said the Head Mistress, blushing.

'Our library,' said Dr. Gaffney, 'contains only books of reference. If our young people need distraction, they can get it at the feelies. We don't encourage them to indulge in any solitary amusements.'

Five bus-loads of boys and girls, singing or in a silent embracement, rolled past them over the vitrified highway.

'Just returned,' explained Dr. Gaffney, while Bernard, whispering, made an appointment with the Head Mistress for that very evening, 'from the Slough Crematorium. Death conditioning begins at eighteen months. Every tot spends two mornings a week in a Hospital for the Dying. All the best toys are kept there, and they get chocolate cream on death days. They learn to take dying as a matter of course.'

'Like any other physiological process,' put in the Head Mistress professionally.

Eight o'clock at the Savoy. It was all arranged.

****
On their way back to London they stopped at the Television Corporation's factory at Brentford.

'Do you mind waiting here a moment while I go and telephone?' asked Bernard.

The Savage waited and watched. The Main Day-Shift was just going off duty. Crowds of lower-caste workers were queued-up in front of the monorail station--seven or eight hundred Gamma, Delta and Epsilon men and women, with not more than a dozen faces and statures between them. To each of them, with his or her ticket, the booking clerk pushed over a little cardboard pillbox. The long caterpillar of men and women moved slowly forward.

'What's in those' (remembering The Merchant of Venice), 'those caskets?' the Savage enquired when Bernard had rejoined him.

'The day's soma ration,' Bernard answered, rather indistinctly; for he was masticating a piece of Benito Hoover's chewing-gum. 'They get it after their work's over. Four half-gramme tablets. Six on Saturdays.'

He took John's arm affectionately and they walked back towards the helicopter.

****
Lenina came singing into the Changing Room.

'You seem very pleased with yourself,' said Fanny.

'I am pleased,' she answered. Zip! 'Bernard rang up half an hour ago.' Zip, zip! She stepped out of her shorts. 'He has an unexpected engagement.' Zip! 'Asked me if I'd take the Savage to the feelies this evening. I must fly.' She hurried away towards the bathroom.

'She's a lucky girl,' Fanny said to herself as she watched Lenina go.

There was no envy in the comment; good-natured Fanny was merely stating a fact. Lenina was lucky; lucky in having shared with Bernard a generous portion of the Savage's immense celebrity, lucky in reflecting from her insignificant person the moment's supremely fashionable glory. Had not the Secretary of the Young Women's Fordian Association asked her to give a lecture about her experiences? Had she not been invited to the Annual Dinner of the Aphroditæum Club? Had she not already appeared in the Feelytone News--visibly, audibly and tactually appeared to countless millions all over the planet?

Hardly less flattering had been the attentions paid her by conspicuous individuals. The Resident World Controller's Second Secretary had asked her to dinner and breakfast. She had spent one week-end with the Ford Chief-Justice, and another with the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury. The President of the Internal and External Secretions Corporation was perpetually on the phone, and she had been to Deauville with the Deputy-Governor of the Bank of Europe.

'It's wonderful, of course. And yet in a way,' she had confessed to Fanny, 'I feel as though I were getting something on false pretences. Because, of course, the first thing they all want to know is what it's like to make love to a Savage. And I have to say I don't know.' She shook her head. 'Most of the men don't believe me, of course. But it's true. I wish it weren't,' she added sadly and sighed. 'He's terribly good-looking; don't you think so?'

'But doesn't he like you?' asked Fanny.

'Sometimes I think he does and sometimes I think he doesn't. He always does his best to avoid me; goes out of the room when I come in; won't touch me; won't even look at me. But sometimes if I turn round suddenly, I catch him staring; and then--well, you know how men look when they like you.'

Yes, Fanny knew.

'I can't make it out,' said Lenina.

She couldn't make it out; and not only was bewildered; was also rather upset.

'Because, you see, Fanny, I like him.'

Liked him more and more. Well, now there'd be a real chance, she thought, as she scented herself after her bath. Dab, dab, dab--a real chance. Her high spirits overflowed in song.

'Hug me till you drug me, honey;
  Kiss me till I'm in a coma:
Hug me, honey, snuggly bunny;
  Love's as good as soma.'
****
The scent organ was playing a delightfully refreshing Herbal Capriccio--rippling arpeggios of thyme and lavender, of rosemary, basil, myrtle, tarragon; a series of daring modulations through the spice keys into ambergris; and a slow return through sandalwood, camphor, cedar and new-mown hay (with occasional subtle touches of discord--a whiff of kidney pudding, the faintest suspicion of pig's dung) back to the simple aromatics with which the piece began. The final blast of thyme died away; there was a round of applause; the lights went up. In the synthetic music machine the sound-track roll began to unwind. It was a trio for hyper-violin, super-'cello and oboe-surrogate that now filled the air with its agreeable languor. Thirty or forty bars--and then, against this instrumental background, a much more than human voice began to warble; now throaty, now from the head, now hollow as a flute, now charged with yearning harmonics, it effortlessly passed from Gaspard Forster's low record on the very frontiers of musical tone to a trilled bat-note high above the highest C to which (in 1770, at the Ducal opera of Parma, and to the astonishment of Mozart) Lucrezia Ajugari, alone of all the singers in history, once piercingly gave utterance.

Sunk in their pneumatic stalls, Lenina and the Savage sniffed and listened. It was now the turn also for eyes and skin.

The house lights went down; fiery letters stood out solid and as though self-supported in the darkness. THREE WEEKS IN A HELICOPTER. AN ALL-SUPER-SINGING, SYNTHETIC-TALKING, COLOURED, STEREOSCOPIC FEELY. WITH SYNCHRONIZED SCENT-ORGAN ACCOMPANIMENT.

'Take hold of those metal knobs on the arms of your chair,' whispered Lenina. 'Otherwise you won't get any of the feely effects.'

The Savage did as he was told.

Those fiery letters, meanwhile, had disappeared; there were ten seconds of complete darkness; then suddenly, dazzling and incomparably more solid-looking than they would have seemed in actual flesh and blood, far more real than reality, there stood the stereoscopic images, locked in one another's arms, of a gigantic negro and a golden-haired young brachycephalic Beta-Plus female.

The Savage started. That sensation on his lips! He lifted a hand to his mouth; the titillation ceased; let his hand fall back on the metal knob; it began again. The scent organ, meanwhile, breathed pure musk. Expiringly, a sound-track super-dove cooed 'Oo-oh'; and vibrating only thirty-two times a second, a deeper than African bass made answer: 'Aa-aah.' 'Ooh-ah! Ooh-ah!' the stereoscopic lips came together again, and once more the facial erogenous zones of the six thousand spectators in the Alhambra tingled with almost intolerable galvanic pleasure. 'Ooh...'

The plot of the film was extremely simple. A few minutes after the first Ooh's and Aah's (a duet having been sung and a little love made on that famous bearskin, every hair of which--the Assistant Predestinator was perfectly right--could be separately and distinctly felt), the negro had a helicopter accident, fell on his head. Thump! what a twinge through the forehead! A chorus of ow's and aie's went up from the audience.

The concussion knocked all the negro's conditioning into a cocked hat. He developed for the Beta blonde an exclusive and maniacal passion. She protested. He persisted. There were struggles, pursuits, an assault on a rival, finally a sensational kidnapping. The Beta blonde was ravished away into the sky and kept there, hovering, for three weeks in a wildly anti-social tête-à-tête with the black madman. Finally, after a whole series of adventures and much aerial acrobacy, three handsome young Alphas succeeded in rescuing her. The negro was packed off to an Adult Re-conditioning Centre and the film ended happily and decorously, with the Beta blonde becoming the mistress of all her three rescuers. They interrupted themselves for a moment to sing a synthetic quartet, with full super-orchestral accompaniment and gardenias on the scent organ. Then the bearskin made a final appearance and, amid a blare of sexophones, the last stereoscopic kiss faded into darkness, the last electric titillation died on the lips like a dying moth that quivers, quivers, ever more feebly, ever more faintly, and at last is quite, quite still.

But for Lenina the moth did not completely die. Even after the lights had gone up, while they were shuffling slowly along with the crowd towards the lifts, its ghost still fluttered against her lips, still traced fine shuddering roads of anxiety and pleasure across her skin. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes dewily bright, her breath came deeply. She caught hold of the Savage's arm and pressed it, limp, against her side. He looked down at her for a moment, pale, pained, desiring, and ashamed of his desire. He was not worthy, not... Their eyes for a moment met. What treasures hers promised! A queen's ransom of temperament. Hastily he looked away, disengaged his imprisoned arm. He was obscurely terrified lest she should cease to be something he could feel himself unworthy of.

'I don't think you ought to see things like that,' he said, making haste to transfer from Lenina herself to the surrounding circumstances the blame for any past or possible future lapse from perfection.

'Things like what, John?'

'Like this horrible film.'

'Horrible?' Lenina was genuinely astonished. 'But I thought it was lovely.'

'It was base,' he said indignantly, 'it was ignoble.'

She shook her head. 'I don't know what you mean.' Why was he so queer? Why did he go out of his way to spoil things?

In the taxicopter he hardly even looked at her. Bound by strong vows that had never been pronounced, obedient to laws that had long since ceased to run, he sat averted and in silence. Sometimes, as though a finger had plucked at some taut, almost breaking string, his whole body would shake with a sudden nervous start.

The taxicopter landed on the roof of Lenina's apartment house. 'At last,' she thought exultantly as she stepped out of the cab. At last--even though he had been so queer just now. Standing under a lamp, she peered into her hand-mirror. At last. Yes, her nose was a bit shiny. She shook the loose powder from her puff. While he was paying off the taxi--there would just be time. She rubbed at the shininess, thinking: 'He's terribly good-looking. No need for him to be shy like Bernard. And yet... Any other man would have done it long ago. Well, now at last.' That fragment of a face in the little round mirror suddenly smiled at her.

'Good-night,' said a strangled voice behind her. Lenina wheeled round. He was standing in the doorway of the cab, his eyes fixed, staring; had evidently been staring all this time while she was powdering her nose, waiting--but what for? or hesitating, trying to make up his mind, and all the time thinking, thinking--she could not imagine what extraordinary thoughts. 'Good-night, Lenina,' he repeated, and made a strange grimacing attempt to smile.

'But, John... I thought you were... I mean, aren't you?...'

He shut the door and bent forward to say something to the driver. The cab shot up into the air.

Looking down through the window in the floor, the Savage could see Lenina's upturned face, pale in the bluish light of the lamps. The mouth was open, she was calling. Her foreshortened figure rushed away from him; the diminishing square of the roof seemed to be falling through the darkness.

Five minutes later he was back in his room. From its hiding-place he took out his mouse-nibbled volume, turned with religious care its stained and crumpled pages, and began to read Othello. Othello, he remembered, was like the hero of Three Weeks in a Helicopter--a black man.

Drying her eyes, Lenina walked across the roof to the lift. On her way down to the twenty-seventh floor she pulled out her soma bottle. One gramme, she decided, would not be enough; hers had been more than a one-gramme affliction. But if she took two grammes, she ran the risk of not waking up in time to-morrow morning. She compromised and, into her cupped left palm, shook out three half-gramme tablets.


Chapter XII

Bernard had to shout through the locked door; the Savage would not open.

'But everybody's there, waiting for you.'

'Let them wait,' came back the muffled voice through the door.

'But you know quite well, John' (how difficult it is to sound persuasive at the top of one's voice!), 'I asked them on purpose to meet you.'

'You ought to have asked me first whether I wanted to meet them.'

'But you always came before, John.'

'That's precisely why I don't want to come again.'

'Just to please me,' Bernard bellowingly wheedled. 'Won't you come to please me?'

'No.'

'Do you seriously mean it?'

'Yes.'

Despairingly, 'But what shall I do?' Bernard wailed.

'Go to hell!' bawled the exasperated voice from within.

'But the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury is there to-night.' Bernard was almost in tears.

'Ai yaa tákwa!' It was only in Zuñi that the Savage could adequately express what he felt about the Arch-Community-Songster. 'Háni!' he added as an afterthought; and then (with what derisive ferocity!): 'Sons éso tse-ná.' And he spat on the ground, as Popé might have done.

In the end Bernard had to slink back, diminished, to his rooms and inform the impatient assembly that the Savage would not be appearing that evening. The news was received with indignation. The men were furious at having been tricked into behaving politely to this insignificant fellow with the unsavoury reputation and the heretical opinions. The higher their position in the hierarchy, the deeper their resentment.

'To play such a joke on me,' the Arch-Songster kept repeating, 'on me!'

As for the women, they indignantly felt that they had been had on false pretences--had by a wretched little man who had had alcohol poured into his bottle by mistake--by a creature with a Gamma-Minus physique. It was an outrage, and they said so, more and more loudly. The Head Mistress of Eton was particularly scathing.

Lenina alone said nothing. Pale, her blue eyes clouded with an unwonted melancholy, she sat in a corner, cut off from those who surrounded her by an emotion which they did not share. She had come to the party filled with a strange feeling of anxious exultation. 'In a few minutes,' she had said to herself, as she entered the room, 'I shall be seeing him, talking to him, telling him' (for she had come with her mind made up) 'that I like him--more than anybody I've ever known. And then perhaps he'll say...'

What would he say? The blood had rushed to her cheeks.

'Why was he so strange the other night, after the feelies? So queer. And yet I'm absolutely sure he really does rather like me. I'm sure...'

It was at this moment that Bernard had made his announcement; the Savage wasn't coming to the party.

Lenina suddenly felt all the sensations normally experienced at the beginning of a Violent Passion Surrogate treatment--a sense of dreadful emptiness, a breathless apprehension, a nausea. Her heart seemed to stop beating.

'Perhaps it's because he doesn't like me,' she said to herself. And at once this possibility became an established certainty: John had refused to come because he didn't like her. He didn't like her....

'It really is a bit too thick,' the Head Mistress of Eton was saying to the Director of Crematoria and Phosphorus Reclamation. 'When I think that I actually...'

'Yes,' came the voice of Fanny Crowne, 'it's absolutely true about the alcohol. Some one I know knew some one who was working in the Embryo Store at the time. She said to my friend, and my friend said to me...'

'Too bad, too bad,' said Henry Foster, sympathizing with the Arch-Community-Songster. 'It may interest you to know that our ex-Director was on the point of transferring him to Iceland.'

Pierced by every word that was spoken, the tight balloon of Bernard's happy self-confidence was leaking from a thousand wounds. Pale, distraught, abject and agitated, he moved among his guests, stammering incoherent apologies, assuring them that next time the Savage would certainly be there, begging them to sit down and take a carotine sandwich, a slice of vitamin A pâté, a glass of champagne-surrogate. They duly ate, but ignored him; drank and were either rude to his face or talked to one another about him, loudly and offensively as though he had not been there.

'And now, my friends,' said the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury, in that beautiful ringing voice with which he led the proceedings at Ford's Day Celebrations, 'Now, my friends, I think perhaps the time has come...' He rose, put down his glass, brushed from his purple viscose waistcoat the crumbs of a considerable collation, and walked towards the door.

Bernard darted forward to intercept him.

'Must you really, Arch-Songster?... It's very early still. I'd hoped you would...'

Yes, what hadn't he hoped, when Lenina confidentially told him that the Arch-Community-Songster would accept an invitation if it were sent. 'He's really rather sweet, you know.' And she had shown Bernard the little golden zipper-fastening in the form of a T which the Arch-Songster had given her as a memento of the week-end she had spent at the Diocesan Singery. To meet the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury and Mr. Savage. Bernard had proclaimed his triumph on every invitation card. But the Savage had chosen this evening of all evenings to lock himself up in his room, to shout 'Háni!' and even (it was lucky that Bernard didn't understand Zuñi) 'Sons éso tse-ná!' What should have been the crowning moment of Bernard's whole career had turned out to be the moment of his greatest humiliation.

'I'd so much hoped...' he stammeringly repeated, looking up at the great dignitary with pleading and distracted eyes.

'My young friend,' said the Arch-Community-Songster in a tone of loud and solemn severity; there was a general silence. 'Let me give you a word of advice.' He wagged his finger at Bernard. 'Before it's too late. A word of good advice.' (His voice became sepulchral.) 'Mend your ways, my young friend, mend your ways.' He made the sign of the T over him and turned away. 'Lenina, my dear,' he called in another tone. 'Come with me.'

Obediently, but unsmiling and (wholly insensible of the honour done to her) without elation, Lenina walked after him, out of the room. The other guests followed at a respectful interval. The last of them slammed the door. Bernard was all alone.

Punctured, utterly deflated, he dropped into a chair and, covering his face with his hands, began to weep. A few minutes later, however, he thought better of it and took four tablets of soma.

****
Upstairs in his room the Savage was reading Romeo and Juliet.

****
Lenina and the Arch-Community-Songster stepped out on to the roof of the Singery. 'Hurry up, my young friend--I mean, Lenina,' called the Arch-Songster impatiently from the lift gates. Lenina, who had lingered for a moment to look at the moon, dropped her eyes and came hurrying across the roof to rejoin him.

****
'A New Theory of Biology' was the title of the paper which Mustapha Mond had just finished reading. He sat for some time, meditatively frowning, then picked up his pen and wrote across the title-page. 'The author's mathematical treatment of the conception of purpose is novel and highly ingenious, but heretical and, so far as the present social order is concerned, dangerous and potentially subversive. Not to be published.' He underlined the words. 'The author will be kept under supervision. His transference to the Marine Biological Station of St. Helena may become necessary.' A pity, he thought, as he signed his name. It was a masterly piece of work. But once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose--well, you didn't know what the result might be. It was the sort of idea that might easily de-condition the more unsettled minds among the higher castes--make them lose their faith in happiness as the Sovereign Good and take to believing, instead, that the goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside the present human sphere; that the purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being, but some intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge. Which was, the Controller reflected, quite possibly true. But not, in the present circumstance, admissible. He picked up his pen again, and under the words 'Not to be published' drew a second line, thicker and blacker than the first; then sighed. 'What fun it would be,' he thought, 'if one didn't have to think about happiness!'

****
With closed eyes, his face shining with rapture, John was softly declaiming to vacancy:

'O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear....'
****
The golden T lay shining on Lenina's bosom. Sportively, the Arch-Community-Songster caught hold of it, sportively he pulled, pulled. 'I think,' said Lenina suddenly, breaking a long silence, 'I'd better take a couple of grammes of soma.'

****
Bernard, by this time, was fast asleep and smiling at the private paradise of his dreams. Smiling, smiling. But inexorably, every thirty seconds, the minute hand of the electric clock above his bed jumped forward with an almost imperceptible click. Click, click, click, click... And it was morning. Bernard was back among the miseries of space and time. It was in the lowest spirits that he taxied across to his work at the Conditioning Centre. The intoxication of success had evaporated; he was soberly his old self; and by contrast with the temporary balloon of these last weeks, the old self seemed unprecedentedly heavier than the surrounding atmosphere.

To this deflated Bernard the Savage showed himself unexpectedly sympathetic.

'You're more like what you were at Malpais,' he said, when Bernard had told him his plaintive story. 'Do you remember when we first talked together? Outside the little house. You're like what you were then.'

'Because I'm unhappy again; that's why.'

'Well, I'd rather be unhappy than have the sort of false, lying happiness you were having here.'

'I like that,' said Bernard bitterly. 'When it's you who were the cause of it all. Refusing to come to my party and so turning them all against me!' He knew that what he was saying was absurd in its injustice; he admitted inwardly, and at last even aloud, the truth of all that the Savage now said about the worthlessness of friends who could be turned upon so slight a provocation into persecuting enemies. But in spite of this knowledge and these admissions, in spite of the fact that his friend's support and sympathy were now his only comfort, Bernard continued perversely to nourish, along with his quite genuine affection, a secret grievance against the Savage, to meditate a campaign of small revenges to be wreaked upon him. Nourishing a grievance against the Arch-Community-Songster was useless; there was no possibility of being revenged on the Chief Bottler or the Assistant Predestinator. As a victim, the Savage possessed, for Bernard, this enormous superiority over the others: that he was accessible. One of the principal functions of a friend is to suffer (in a milder and symbolic form) the punishments that we should like, but are unable, to inflict upon our enemies.

Bernard's other victim-friend was Helmholtz. When, discomfited, he came and asked once more for the friendship which in his prosperity he had not thought it worth his while to preserve, Helmholtz gave it; and gave it without a reproach, without a comment, as though he had forgotten that there had ever been a quarrel. Touched, Bernard felt himself at the same time humiliated by this magnanimity--a magnanimity the more extraordinary and therefore the more humiliating in that it owed nothing to soma and everything to Helmholtz's character. It was the Helmholtz of daily life who forgot and forgave, not the Helmholtz of a half-gramme holiday. Bernard was duly grateful (it was an enormous comfort to have his friend again) and also duly resentful (it would be a pleasure to take some revenge on Helmholtz for his generosity.)

At their first meeting after the estrangement, Bernard poured out the tale of his miseries and accepted consolation. It was not till some days later that he learned, to his surprise and with a twinge of shame, that he was not the only one who had been in trouble. Helmholtz had also come into conflict with Authority.

'It was over some rhymes,' he explained. 'I was giving my usual course of Advanced Emotional Engineering for Third Year Students. Twelve lectures, of which the seventh is about rhymes. "On the Use of Rhymes in Moral Propaganda and Advertisement," to be precise. I always illustrate my lecture with a lot of technical examples. This time I thought I'd give them one I'd just written myself. Pure madness, of course; but I couldn't resist it.' He laughed. 'I was curious to see what their reactions would be. Besides,' he added more gravely, 'I wanted to do a bit of propaganda; I was trying to engineer them into feeling as I'd felt when I wrote the rhymes. Ford!' He laughed again. 'What an outcry there was! The Principal had me up and threatened to hand me the immediate sack. I'm a marked man.'

'But what were your rhymes?' Bernard asked.

'They were about being alone.'

Bernard's eyebrows went up.

'I'll recite them to you, if you like.' And Helmholtz began:

'Yesterday's committee,
Sticks, but a broken drum,
Midnight in the City,
Flutes in a vacuum,
Shut lips, sleeping faces,
Every stopped machine,
The dumb and littered places
Where crowds have been--
All silences rejoice,
Weep (loudly or low),
Speak--but with the voice
Of whom, I do not know.
Absence, say, of Susan's,
Absence of Egeria's
Arms and respective bosoms,
Lips and, ah, posteriors,
Slowly form a presence;
Whose? and, I ask, of what
So absurd an essence,
That something, which is not,
Nevertheless should populate
Empty night more solidly
Than that with which we copulate,
Why should it seem so squalidly?
Well, I gave them that as an example, and they reported me to the Principal.'

'I'm not surprised,' said Bernard. 'It's flatly against all their sleep-teaching. Remember, they've had at least a quarter of a million warnings against solitude.'

'I know. But I thought I'd like to see what the effect would be.'

'Well, you've seen now.'

Helmholtz only laughed. 'I feel,' he said, after a silence, 'as though I were just beginning to have something to write about. As though I were beginning to be able to use that power I feel I've got inside me--that extra, latent power. Something seems to be coming to me.' In spite of all his troubles, he seemed, Bernard thought, profoundly happy.

Helmholtz and the Savage took to one another at once. So cordially indeed that Bernard felt a sharp pang of jealousy. In all these weeks he had never come to so close an intimacy with the Savage as Helmholtz immediately achieved. Watching them, listening to their talk, he found himself sometimes resentfully wishing that he had never brought them together. He was ashamed of his jealousy and alternately made efforts of will and took soma to keep himself from feeling it. But the efforts were not very successful; and between the soma-holidays there were, of necessity, intervals. The odious sentiment kept on returning.

At his third meeting with the Savage, Helmholtz recited his rhymes on Solitude.

'What do you think of them?' he asked when he had done.

The Savage shook his head. 'Listen to this,' was his answer; and unlocking the drawer in which he kept his mouse-eaten book, he opened and read:

'Let the bird of loudest lay,
On the sole Arabian tree,
Herald sad and trumpet be...'
Helmholtz listened with a growing excitement. At 'sole Arabian tree' he started; at 'thou shrieking harbinger' he smiled with sudden pleasure; at 'every fowl of tyrant wing' the blood rushed up into his cheeks; but at 'defunctive music' he turned pale and trembled with an unprecedented emotion. The Savage read on:

'Property was thus appall'd,
That the self was not the same;
Single nature's double name
Neither two nor one was call'd.

Reason in itself confounded
Saw division grow together...'
'Orgy-porgy!' said Bernard, interrupting the reading with a loud, unpleasant laugh. 'It's just a Solidarity Service hymn.' He was revenging himself on his two friends for liking one another more than they liked him.

In the course of their next two or three meetings he frequently repeated this little act of vengeance. It was simple and, since both Helmholtz and the Savage were dreadfully pained by the shattering and defilement of a favourite poetic crystal, extremely effective. In the end, Helmholtz threatened to kick him out of the room if he dared to interrupt again. And yet, strangely enough, the next interruption, the most disgraceful of all, came from Helmholtz himself.

The Savage was reading Romeo and Juliet aloud--reading (for all the time he was seeing himself as Romeo and Lenina as Juliet) with an intense and quivering passion. Helmholtz had listened to the scene of the lovers' first meeting with a puzzled interest. The scene in the orchard had delighted him with its poetry; but the sentiments expressed had made him smile. Getting into such a state about having a girl--it seemed rather ridiculous. But, taken detail by verbal detail, what a superb piece of emotional engineering! 'That old fellow,' he said, 'he makes our best propaganda technicians look absolutely silly.' The Savage smiled triumphantly and resumed his reading. All went tolerably well until, in the last scene of the third act, Capulet and Lady Capulet began to bully Juliet to marry Paris. Helmholtz had been restless throughout the entire scene; but when, pathetically mimed by the Savage, Juliet cried out:

'Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies...'
when Juliet said this, Helmholtz broke out in an explosion of uncontrollable guffawing.

The mother and father (grotesque obscenity) forcing the daughter to have some one she didn't want! And the idiotic girl not saying that she was having some one else whom (for the moment, at any rate) she preferred! In its smutty absurdity the situation was irresistibly comical. He had managed, with a heroic effort, to hold down the mounting pressure of his hilarity; but 'sweet mother' (in the Savage's tremulous tone of anguish) and the reference to Tybalt lying dead, but evidently uncremated and wasting his phosphorus on a dim monument, were too much for him. He laughed and laughed till the tears streamed down his face--quenchlessly laughed while, pale with a sense of outrage, the Savage looked at him over the top of his book and then, as the laughter still continued, closed it indignantly, got up and, with the gesture of one who removes his pearl from before swine, locked it away in its drawer.

'And yet,' said Helmholtz when, having recovered breath enough to apologize, he had mollified the Savage into listening to his explanations, 'I know quite well that one needs ridiculous, mad situations like that; one can't write really well about anything else. Why was that old fellow such a marvellous propaganda technician? Because he had so many insane, excruciating things to get excited about. You've got to be hurt and upset; otherwise you can't think of the really good, penetrating, X-rayish phrases. But fathers and mothers!' He shook his head. 'You can't expect me to keep a straight face about fathers and mothers. And who's going to get excited about a boy having a girl or not having her?' (The Savage winced; but Helmholtz, who was staring pensively at the floor, saw nothing.) 'No,' he concluded, with a sigh, 'it won't do. We need some other kind of madness and violence. But what? What? Where can one find it?' He was silent; then, shaking his head, 'I don't know,' he said at last, 'I don't know.'


Chapter XIII

Henry Foster loomed up through the twilight of the Embryo Store.

'Like to come to a feely this evening?'

Lenina shook her head without speaking.

'Going out with some one else?' It interested him to know which of his friends was being had by which other. 'Is it Benito?' he questioned.

She shook her head again.

Henry detected the weariness in those purple eyes, the pallor beneath that glaze of lupus, the sadness at the corners of the unsmiling crimson mouth. 'You're not feeling ill, are you?' he asked, a trifle anxiously, afraid that she might be suffering from one of the few remaining infectious diseases.

Yet once more Lenina shook her head.

'Anyhow, you ought to go and see the doctor,' said Henry. 'A doctor a day keeps the jim-jams away,' he added heartily, driving home his hypnopædic adage with a clap on the shoulder. 'Perhaps you need a Pregnancy Substitute,' he suggested. 'Or else an extra-strong V.P.S. treatment. Sometimes, you know, the standard passion-surrogate isn't quite...'

'Oh, for Ford's sake,' said Lenina, breaking her stubborn silence, 'shut up!' And she turned back to her neglected embryos.

A V.P.S. treatment indeed! She would have laughed, if she hadn't been on the point of crying. As though she hadn't got enough V.P. of her own! She sighed profoundly as she refilled her syringe. 'John,' she murmured to herself, 'John...' Then 'My Ford,' she wondered, 'have I given this one its sleeping-sickness injection, or haven't I?' She simply couldn't remember. In the end, she decided not to run the risk of letting it have a second dose, and moved down the line to the next bottle.

Twenty-two years eight months and four days from that moment, a promising young Alpha-Minus administrator at Mwanza-Mwanza was to die of trypanosomiasis--the first case for over half a century. Sighing, Lenina went on with her work.

An hour later, in the Changing Room, Fanny was energetically protesting. 'But it's absurd to let yourself get into a state like this. Simply absurd,' she repeated. 'And what about? A man--one man.'

'But he's the one I want.'

'As though there weren't millions of other men in the world.'

'But I don't want them.'

'How can you know till you've tried?'

'I have tried.'

'But how many?' asked Fanny, shrugging her shoulders contemptuously. 'One, two?'

'Dozens. But,' shaking her head, 'it wasn't any good,' she added.

'Well, you must persevere,' said Fanny sententiously. But it was obvious that her confidence in her own prescriptions had been shaken. 'Nothing can be achieved without perseverance.'

'But meanwhile...'

'Don't think of him.'

'I can't help it.'

'Take soma, then.'

'I do.'

'Well, go on.'

'But in the intervals I still like him. I shall always like him.'

'Well, if that's the case,' said Fanny, with decision, 'why don't you just go and take him. Whether he wants it or no.'

'But if you knew how terribly queer he was!'

'All the more reason for taking a firm line.'

'It's all very well to say that.'

'Don't stand any nonsense. Act.' Fanny's voice was a trumpet; she might have been a Y.W.F.A. lecturer giving an evening talk to adolescent Beta-Minuses. 'Yes, act--at once. Do it now.'

'I'd be scared,' said Lenina.

'Well, you've only got to take half a gramme of soma first. And now I'm going to have my bath.' She marched off, trailing her towel.

****
The bell rang, and the Savage, who was impatiently hoping that Helmholtz would come that afternoon (for having at last made up his mind to talk to Helmholtz about Lenina, he could not bear to postpone his confidences a moment longer), jumped up and ran to the door.

'I had a premonition it was you, Helmholtz,' he shouted as he opened.

On the threshold, in a white acetate-satin sailor suit, and with a round white cap rakishly tilted over her left ear, stood Lenina.

'Oh!' said the Savage, as though some one had struck him a heavy blow.

Half a gramme had been enough to make Lenina forget her fears and her embarrassments. 'Hullo, John,' she said, smiling, and walked past him into the room. Automatically he closed the door and followed her. Lenina sat down. There was a long silence.

'You don't seem very glad to see me, John,' she said at last.

'Not glad?' The Savage looked at her reproachfully; then suddenly fell on his knees before her and, taking Lenina's hand, reverently kissed it. 'Not glad? Oh, if you only knew,' he whispered, and, venturing to raise his eyes to her face, 'Admired Lenina,' he went on, 'indeed the top of admiration, worth what's dearest in the world.' She smiled at him with a luscious tenderness. 'Oh, you so perfect' (she was leaning towards him with parted lips), 'so perfect and so peerless are created' (nearer and nearer) 'of every creature's best.' Still nearer. The Savage suddenly scrambled to his feet. 'That's why,' he said, speaking with averted face,' I wanted to do something first... I mean, to show I was worthy of you. Not that I could ever really be that. But at any rate to show I wasn't absolutely unworthy. I wanted to do something.'

'Why should you think it necessary...' Lenina began, but left the sentence unfinished. There was a note of irritation in her voice. When one has leant forward, nearer and nearer, with parted lips--only to find oneself, quite suddenly, as a clumsy oaf scrambles to his feet, leaning towards nothing at all--well, there is a reason, even with half a gramme of soma circulating in one's blood-stream, a genuine reason for annoyance.

'At Malpais,' the Savage was incoherently mumbling, 'you had to bring her the skin of a mountain lion--I mean, when you wanted to marry some one. Or else a wolf.'

'There aren't any lions in England,' Lenina almost snapped.

'And even if there were,' the Savage added, with sudden contemptuous resentment, 'people would kill them out of helicopters, I suppose, with poison gas or something. I wouldn't do that, Lenina.' He squared his shoulders, he ventured to look at her and was met with a stare of annoyed incomprehension. Confused, 'I'll do anything,' he went on, more and more incoherently. 'Anything you tell me. There be some sports are painful--you know. But their labour delight in them sets off. That's what I feel. I mean I'd sweep the floor if you wanted.'

'But we've got vacuum cleaners here,' said Lenina in bewilderment. 'It isn't necessary.'

'No, of course it isn't necessary. But some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone. I'd like to undergo something nobly. Don't you see?'

'But if there are vacuum cleaners...'

'That's not the point.'

'And Epsilon Semi-Morons to work them,' she went on, 'well, really, why?'

'Why? But for you, for you. Just to show that I...'

'And what on earth vacuum cleaners have got to do with lions...'

'To show how much...'

'Or lions with being glad to see me...' She was getting more and more exasperated.

'How much I love you, Lenina,' he brought out almost desperately.

An emblem of the inner tide of startled elation, the blood rushed up into Lenina's cheeks. 'Do you mean it, John?'

'But I hadn't meant to say so,' cried the Savage, clasping his hands in a kind of agony. 'Not until... Listen, Lenina; in Malpais people get married.'

'Get what?' The irritation had begun to creep back into her voice. What was he talking about now?

'For always. They make a promise to live together for always.'

'What a horrible idea!' Lenina was genuinely shocked.

'Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays.'

'What?'

'It's like that in Shakespeare too. "If thou dost break her virgin knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite..."'

'For Ford's sake, John, talk sense. I can't understand a word you say. First it's vacuum cleaners; then it's knots. You're driving me crazy.' She jumped up and, as though afraid that he might run away from her physically, as well as with his mind, caught him by the wrist. 'Answer me this question: do you really like me, or don't you?'

There was a moment's silence; then, in a very low voice, 'I love you more than anything in the world,' he said.

'Then why on earth didn't you say so?' she cried, and so intense was her exasperation that she drove her sharp nails into the skin of his wrist. 'Instead of drivelling away about knots and vacuum cleaners and lions, and making me miserable for weeks and weeks.'

She released his hand and flung it angrily away from her.

'If I didn't like you so much,' she said, 'I'd be furious with you.'

And suddenly her arms were round his neck; he felt her lips soft against his own. So deliciously soft, so warm and electric that inevitably he found himself thinking of the embraces in Three Weeks in a Helicopter. Ooh! ooh! the stereoscopic blonde and aah! the more than real blackamoor. Horror, horror, horror... he tried to disengage himself; but Lenina tightened her embrace.

'Why didn't you say so?' she whispered, drawing back her face to look at him. Her eyes were tenderly reproachful.

'The murkiest den, the most opportune place' (the voice of conscience thundered poetically), 'the strongest suggestion our worser genius can, shall never melt mine honour into lust. Never, never!' he resolved.

'You silly boy!' she was saying. 'I wanted you so much. And if you wanted me too, why didn't you?...'

'But, Lenina...' he began protesting; and as she immediately untwined her arms, as she stepped away from him, he thought, for a moment, that she had taken his unspoken hint. But when she unbuckled her white patent cartridge belt and hung it carefully over the back of a chair, he began to suspect that he had been mistaken.

'Lenina!' he repeated apprehensively.

She put her hand to her neck and gave a long vertical pull; her white sailor's blouse was ripped to the hem; suspicion condensed into a too, too solid certainty. 'Lenina, what are you doing?'

Zip, zip! Her answer was wordless. She stepped out of her bell-bottomed trousers. Her zippicamiknicks were a pale shell pink. The Arch-Community-Songster's golden T dangled at her breast.

'For those milk paps that through the window bars bore at men's eyes...' The singing, thundering, magical words made her seem doubly dangerous, doubly alluring. Soft, soft, but how piercing! boring and drilling into reason, tunnelling through resolution. 'The strongest oaths are straw to the fire i' the blood. Be more abstemious, or else...'

Zip! The rounded pinkness fell apart like a neatly divided apple. A wriggle of the arms, a lifting first of the right foot, then the left: the zippicamiknicks were lying lifeless and as though deflated on the floor.

Still wearing her shoes and socks, and her rakishly tilted round white cap, she advanced towards him. 'Darling. Darling! If only you'd said so before!' She held out her arms.

But instead of also saying 'Darling!' and holding out his arms, the Savage retreated in terror, flapping his hands at her as though he were trying to scare away some intruding and dangerous animal. Four backward steps, and he was brought to bay against the wall.

'Sweet!' said Lenina and, laying her hands on his shoulders, pressed herself against him. 'Put your arms round me,' she commanded. 'Hug me till you drug me, honey.' She too had poetry at her command, knew words that sang and were spells and beat drums. 'Kiss me'; she closed her eyes, she let her voice sink to a sleepy murmur, 'kiss me till I'm in a coma. Hug me, honey, snuggly...'

The Savage caught her by the wrists, tore her hands from his shoulders, thrust her roughly away at arm's length.

'Ow, you're hurting me, you're... oh!' She was suddenly silent. Terror had made her forget the pain. Opening her eyes, she had seen his face--no, not his face, a ferocious stranger's, pale, distorted, twitching with some insane, inexplicable fury. Aghast, 'But what is it, John?' she whispered. He did not answer, but only stared into her face with those mad eyes. The hands that held her wrists were trembling. He breathed deeply and irregularly. Faint almost to imperceptibility, but appalling, she suddenly heard the grinding of his teeth. 'What is it?' she almost screamed.

And as though awakened by her cry he caught her by the shoulders and shook her. 'Whore!' he shouted. 'Whore! Impudent strumpet!'

'Oh, don't, do-on't,' she protested in a voice made grotesquely tremulous by his shaking.

'Whore!'

'Plea-ease.'

'Damned whore!'

'A gra-amme is be-etter...' she began.

The Savage pushed her away with such force that she staggered and fell. 'Go,' he shouted, standing over her menacingly, 'get out of my sight or I'll kill you.' He clenched his fists.

Lenina raised her arm to cover her face. 'No, please don't, John...'

'Hurry up. Quick!'

One arm still raised, and following his every movement with a terrified eye, she scrambled to her feet and still crouching, still covering her head, made a dash for the bathroom.

The noise of that prodigious slap by which her departure was accelerated was like a pistol-shot.

'Ow!' Lenina bounded forward.

Safely locked into the bathroom, she had leisure to take stock of her injuries. Standing with her back to the mirror, she twisted her head. Looking over her left shoulder she could see the imprint of an open hand standing out distinct and crimson on the pearly flesh. Gingerly she rubbed the wounded spot.

Outside, in the other room, the Savage was striding up and down, marching, marching to the drums and music of magical words. 'The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight.' Maddeningly they rumbled in his ears. 'The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't with a more riotous appetite. Down from the waist they are Centaurs, though women all above. But to the girdle do the gods inherit. Beneath is all the fiends'. There's hell, there's darkness, there is the sulphurous pit, burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie, fie, fie, pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination.'

'John!' ventured a small ingratiating voice from the bathroom. 'John!'

'O thou weed, who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet that the sense aches at thee. Was this most goodly book made to write "whore" upon? Heaven stops the nose at it...'

But her perfume still hung about him, his jacket was white with the powder that had scented her velvety body. 'Impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet.' The inexorable rhythm beat itself out. 'Impudent...'

'John, do you think I might have my clothes?'

He picked up the bell-bottomed trousers, the blouse, the zippicamiknicks.

'Open!' he ordered, kicking the door.

'No, I won't.' The voice was frightened and defiant.

'Well, how do you expect me to give them to you?'

'Push them through the ventilator over the door.'

He did what she suggested and returned to his uneasy pacing of the room. 'Impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet. The devil Luxury with his fat rump and potato finger...'

'John.'

He would not answer. 'Fat rump and potato finger.'

'John.'

'What is it?' he asked gruffly.

'I wonder if you'd mind giving me my Malthusian belt.'

Lenina sat listening to the footsteps in the other room, wondering, as she listened, how long he was likely to go tramping up and down like that; whether she would have to wait until he left the flat; or if it would be safe, after allowing his madness a reasonable time to subside, to open the bathroom door and make a dash for it.

She was interrupted in the midst of these uneasy speculations by the sound of the telephone bell ringing in the other room. Abruptly the tramping ceased. She heard the voice of the Savage parleying with silence.

'Hullo.'

......

'Yes.'

......

'If I do not usurp myself, I am.'

......

'Yes, didn't you hear me say so? Mr. Savage speaking.'

......

'What? Who's ill? Of course it interests me.'

......

'But is it serious? Is she really bad? I'll go at once....'

......

'Not in her rooms any more? Where has she been taken?'

......

'Oh, my God! What's the address?'

......

'Three Park Lane--is that it? Three? Thanks.'

Lenina heard the click of the replaced receiver, then hurrying steps. A door slammed. There was silence. Was he really gone?

With an infinity of precautions she opened the door a quarter of an inch; peeped through the crack; was encouraged by the view of emptiness; opened a little further, and put her whole head out; finally tiptoed into the room; stood for a few seconds with strongly beating heart, listening, listening; then darted to the front door, opened, slipped through, slammed, ran. It was not till she was in the lift and actually dropping down the well that she began to feel herself secure.


Chapter XIV

The Park Lane Hospital for the Dying was a sixty-story tower of primrose tiles. As the Savage stepped out of his taxicopter a convoy of gaily-coloured aerial hearses rose whirring from the roof and darted away across the Park, westwards, bound for the Slough Crematorium. At the lift gates the presiding porter gave him the information he required, and he dropped down to Ward 81 (a Galloping Senility ward, the porter explained) on the seventeenth floor.

It was a large room bright with sunshine and yellow paint, and containing twenty beds, all occupied. Linda was dying in company--in company and with all the modern conveniences. The air was continuously alive with gay synthetic melodies. At the foot of every bed, confronting its moribund occupant, was a television box. Television was left on, a running tap, from morning till night. Every quarter of an hour the prevailing perfume of the room was automatically changed. 'We try,' explained the nurse, who had taken charge of the Savage at the door, 'we try to create a thoroughly pleasant atmosphere here--something between a first-class hotel and a feely-palace, if you take my meaning.'

'Where is she?' asked the Savage, ignoring these polite explanations.

The nurse was offended. 'You are in a hurry,' she said.

'Is there any hope?' he asked.

'You mean, of her not dying?' (He nodded.) 'No, of course there isn't. When somebody's sent here, there's no...' Startled by the expression of distress on his pale face, she suddenly broke off. 'Why, whatever is the matter?' she asked. She was not accustomed to this kind of thing in visitors. (Not that there were many visitors anyhow: or any reason why there should be many visitors.) 'You're not feeling ill, are you?'

He shook his head. 'She's my mother,' he said in a scarcely audible voice.

The nurse glanced at him with startled, horrified eyes; then quickly looked away. From throat to temple she was all one hot blush.

'Take me to her,' said the Savage, making an effort to speak in an ordinary tone.

Still blushing, she led the way down the ward. Faces still fresh and unwithered (for senility galloped so hard that it had no time to age the cheeks--only the heart and brain) turned as they passed. Their progress was followed by the blank, incurious eyes of second infancy. The Savage shuddered as he looked.

Linda was lying in the last of the long row of beds, next to the wall. Propped up on pillows, she was watching the Semi-finals of the South American Riemann-Surface Tennis Championship, which were being played in silent and diminished reproduction on the screen of the television box at the foot of the bed. Hither and thither across their square of illumined glass the little figures noiselessly darted, like fish in an aquarium--the silent but agitated inhabitants of another world.

Linda looked on, vaguely and uncomprehendingly smiling. Her pale, bloated face wore an expression of imbecile happiness. Every now and then her eyelids closed, and for a few seconds she seemed to be dozing. Then with a little start she would wake up again--wake up to the aquarium antics of the Tennis Champions, to the Super-Vox-Wurlitzeriana rendering of 'Hug me till you drug me, honey,' to the warm draught of verbena that came blowing through the ventilator above her head--would wake to these things, or rather to a dream of which these things, transformed and embellished by the soma in her blood, were the marvellous constituents, and smile once more her broken and discoloured smile of infantile contentment.

'Well, I must go,' said the nurse. 'I've got my batch of children coming. Besides, there's Number 3.' She pointed up the ward. 'Might go off any minute now. Well, make yourself comfortable.' She walked briskly away.

The Savage sat down beside the bed.

'Linda,' he whispered, taking her hand.

At the sound of her name, she turned. Her vague eyes brightened with recognition. She squeezed his hand, she smiled, her lips moved; then quite suddenly her head fell forward. She was asleep. He sat watching her--seeking through the tired flesh, seeking and finding that young, bright face which had stooped over his childhood in Malpais, remembering (and he closed his eyes) her voice, her movements, all the events of their life together. 'Streptocock-Gee to Banbury-T...' How beautiful her singing had been! And those childish rhymes, how magically strange and mysterious!

A, B, C, vitamin D:
The fat's in the liver, the cod's in the sea.
He felt the hot tears welling up behind his eyelids as he recalled the words and Linda's voice as she repeated them. And then the reading lessons; The tot is in the pot, the cat is on the mat; and the Elementary Instructions for Beta Workers in the Embryo Store. And long evenings by the fire or, in summer time, on the roof of the little house, when she told him those stories about the Other Place, outside the Reservation: that beautiful, beautiful Other Place, whose memory, as of a heaven, a paradise of goodness and loveliness, he still kept whole and intact, undefiled by contact with the reality of this real London, these actual civilized men and women.

A sudden noise of shrill voices made him open his eyes and, after hastily brushing away the tears, look round. What seemed an interminable stream of identical eight-year-old male twins was pouring into the room. Twin after twin, twin after twin, they came--a nightmare. Their faces, their repeated face--for there was only one between the lot of them--puggishly stared, all nostrils and pale goggling eyes. Their uniform was khaki. All their mouths hung open. Squealing and chattering they entered. In a moment, it seemed, the ward was maggoty with them. They swarmed between the beds, clambered over, crawled under, peeped into the television boxes, made faces at the patients.

Linda astonished and rather alarmed them. A group stood clustered at the foot of her bed, staring with the frightened and stupid curiosity of animals suddenly confronted by the unknown.

'Oh, look, look!' They spoke in low, scared voices. 'Whatever is the matter with her? Why is she so fat?'

They had never seen a face like hers before--had never seen a face that was not youthful and taut-skinned, a body that had ceased to be slim and upright. All these moribund sexagenarians had the appearance of childish girls. At forty-four, Linda seemed, by contrast, a monster of flaccid and distorted senility.

'Isn't she awful?' came the whispered comments. 'Look at her teeth!'

Suddenly from under the bed a pug-faced twin popped up between John's chair and the wall, and began peering into Linda's sleeping face.

'I say...' he began; but his sentence ended prematurely in a squeal. The Savage had seized him by the collar, lifted him clear over the chair and, with a smart box on the ears, sent him howling away.

His yells brought the Head Nurse hurrying to the rescue.

'What have you been doing to him?' she demanded fiercely. 'I won't have you striking the children.'

'Well, then, keep them away from this bed.' The Savage's voice was trembling with indignation. 'What are these filthy little brats doing here at all? It's disgraceful!'

'Disgraceful? But what do you mean? They're being death-conditioned. And I tell you,' she warned him truculently, 'if I have any more of your interference with their conditioning, I'll send for the porters and have you thrown out.'

The Savage rose to his feet and took a couple of steps towards her. His movements and the expression on his face were so menacing that the nurse fell back in terror. With a great effort he checked himself and, without speaking, turned away and sat down again by the bed.

Reassured, but with a dignity that was a trifle shrill and uncertain, 'I've warned you,' said the nurse, 'so mind.' Still, she led the too inquisitive twins away and made them join in the game of hunt-the-zipper, which had been organized by one of her colleagues at the other end of the room.

'Run along now and have your cup of caffeine solution, dear,' she said to the other nurse. The exercise of authority restored her confidence, made her feel better. 'Now, children!' she called.

Linda had stirred uneasily, had opened her eyes for a moment, looked vaguely around, and then once more dropped off to sleep. Sitting beside her, the Savage tried hard to recapture his mood of a few minutes before. 'A, B, C, vitamin D,' he repeated to himself, as though the words were a spell that would restore the dead past to life. But the spell was ineffective. Obstinately the beautiful memories refused to rise; there was only a hateful resurrection of jealousies and uglinesses and miseries. Popé with the blood trickling down from his cut shoulder; and Linda hideously asleep, and the flies buzzing round the spilt mescal on the floor beside the bed; and the boys calling those names as she passed.... Ah, no, no! He shut his eyes, he shook his head in strenuous denial of these memories. 'A, B, C, vitamin D...' He tried to think of those times when he sat on her knees and she put her arms about him and sang, over and over again, rocking him, rocking him to sleep. 'A, B, C, vitamin D, vitamin D, vitamin D...'

The Super-Vox-Wurlitzeriana had risen to a sobbing crescendo; and suddenly the verbena gave place, in the scent-circulating system, to an intense patchouli. Linda stirred, woke up, stared for a few seconds bewilderedly at the Semi-finalists, then, lifting her face, sniffed once or twice at the newly perfumed air and suddenly smiled--a smile of childish ecstasy.

'Popé!' she murmured, and closed her eyes. 'Oh, I do so like it, I do...' She sighed and let herself sink back into the pillows.

'But, Linda!' The Savage spoke imploringly. 'Don't you know me?' He had tried so hard, had done his very best; why wouldn't she allow him to forget? He squeezed her limp hand almost with violence, as though he would force her to come back from this dream of ignoble pleasures, from these base and hateful memories--back into the present, back into reality: the appalling present, the awful reality--but sublime, but significant, but desperately important precisely because of the imminence of that which made them so fearful. 'Don't you know me, Linda?'

He felt the faint answering pressure of her hand. The tears started into his eyes. He bent over her and kissed her.

Her lips moved. 'Popé!' she whispered again, and it was as though he had had a pailful of ordure thrown in his face.

Anger suddenly boiled up in him. Balked for the second time, the passion of his grief had found another outlet, was transformed into a passion of agonized rage.

'But I'm John!' he shouted. 'I'm John!' And in his furious misery he actually caught her by the shoulder and shook her.

Linda's eyes fluttered open; she saw him, knew him--'John!'--but situated the real face, the real and violent hands, in an imaginary world--among the inward and private equivalents of patchouli and the Super-Wurlitzer, among the transfigured memories and the strangely transposed sensations that constituted the universe of her dream. She knew him for John, her son, but fancied him an intruder into that paradisal Malpais where she had been spending her soma-holiday with Popé. He was angry because she liked Popé, he was shaking her because Popé was there in the bed--as though there were something wrong, as though all civilized people didn't do the same? 'Every one belongs to every...' Her voice suddenly died into an almost inaudible breathless croaking, her mouth fell open: she made a desperate effort to fill her lungs with air. But it was as though she had forgotten how to breathe. She tried to cry out--but no sound came; only the terror of her staring eyes revealed what she was suffering. Her hands went to her throat, then clawed at the air--the air she could no longer breathe, the air that, for her, had ceased to exist.

The Savage was on his feet, bent over her. 'What is it, Linda? What is it?' His voice was imploring; it was as though he were begging to be reassured.

The look she gave him was charged with an unspeakable terror--with terror and, it seemed to him, reproach. She tried to raise herself in bed, but fell back on to the pillows. Her face was horribly distorted, her lips blue.

The Savage turned and ran up the ward.

'Quick, quick!' he shouted. 'Quick!'

Standing in the centre of a ring of zipper-hunting twins, the Head Nurse looked round. The first moment's astonishment gave place almost instantly to disapproval. 'Don't shout! Think of the little ones,' she said, frowning. 'You might decondition... But what are you doing?' He had broken through the ring. 'Be careful!' A child was yelling.

'Quick, quick!' He caught her by the sleeve, dragged her after him. 'Quick! Something's happened. I've killed her.'

By the time they were back at the end of the ward Linda was dead.

The Savage stood for a moment in frozen silence, then fell on his knees beside the bed and, covering his face with his hands, sobbed uncontrollably.

The nurse stood irresolute, looking now at the kneeling figure by the bed (the scandalous exhibition!) and now (poor children!) at the twins who had stopped their hunting of the zipper and were staring from the other end of the ward, staring with all their eyes and nostrils at the shocking scene that was being enacted round Bed 20. Should she speak to him? try to bring him back to a sense of decency? remind him of where he was? of what fatal mischief he might do to these poor innocents? Undoing all their wholesome death-conditioning with this disgusting outcry--as though death were something terrible, as though any one mattered as much as all that! It might give them the most disastrous ideas about the subject, might upset them into reacting in the entirely wrong, the utterly anti-social way.

She stepped forward, she touched him on the shoulder. 'Can't you behave?' she said in a low, angry voice. But, looking round, she saw that half a dozen twins were already on their feet and advancing down the ward. The circle was disintegrating. In another moment... No, the risk was too great; the whole Group might be put back six or seven months in its conditioning. She hurried back towards her menaced charges.

'Now, who wants a chocolate éclair?' she asked in a loud, cheerful tone.

'Me!' yelled the entire Bokanovsky Group in chorus. Bed 20 was completely forgotten.

'Oh, God, God, God...' the Savage kept repeating to himself. In the chaos of grief and remorse that filled his mind it was the one articulate word. 'God!' he whispered it aloud. 'God...'

'Whatever is he saying?' said a voice, very near, distinct and shrill through the warblings of the Super-Wurlitzer.

The Savage violently started and, uncovering his face, looked round. Five khaki twins, each with the stump of a long éclair in his right hand, and their identical faces variously smeared with liquid chocolate, were standing in a row, puggily goggling at him.

They met his eyes and simultaneously grinned. One of them pointed with his éclair butt.

'Is she dead?' he asked.

The Savage stared at them for a moment in silence. Then, in silence he rose to his feet, in silence slowly walked towards the door.

'Is she dead?' repeated the inquisitive twin trotting at his side.

The Savage looked down at him and still without speaking pushed him away. The twin fell on the floor and at once began to howl. The Savage did not even look round.


Chapter XV

The menial staff of the Park Lane Hospital for the Dying consisted of one hundred and sixty-two Deltas divided into two Bokanovsky Groups of eighty-four red-headed female and seventy-eight dark dolichocephalic male twins, respectively. At six, when their working day was over, the two Groups assembled in the vestibule of the Hospital and were served by the Deputy Sub-Bursar with their soma ration.

From the lift the Savage stepped out into the midst of them. But his mind was elsewhere--with death, with his grief, and his remorse; mechanically, without consciousness of what he was doing, he began to shoulder his way through the crowd.

'Who are you pushing? Where do you think you're going?'

High, low, from a multitude of separate throats, only two voices squeaked or growled. Repeated indefinitely, as though by a train of mirrors, two faces, one a hairless and freckled moon haloed in orange, the other a thin, beaked bird-mask, stubbly with two days' beard, turned angrily towards him. Their words and, in his ribs, the sharp nudging of elbows, broke through his unawareness. He woke once more to external reality, looked round him, knew what he saw--knew it, with a sinking sense of horror and disgust, for the recurrent delirium of his days and nights, the nightmare of swarming indistinguishable sameness. Twins, twins.... Like maggots they had swarmed defilingly over the mystery of Linda's death. Maggots again, but larger, full grown, they now crawled across his grief and his repentance. He halted and, with bewildered and horrified eyes, stared round him at the khaki mob, in the midst of which, overtopping it by a full head, he stood. 'How many goodly creatures are there here!' The singing words mocked him derisively. 'How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world...'

'Soma distribution!' shouted a loud voice. 'In good order, please. Hurry up there.'

A door had been opened, a table and chair carried into the vestibule. The voice was that of a jaunty young Alpha, who had entered carrying a black iron cash-box. A murmur of satisfaction went up from the expectant twins. They forgot all about the Savage. Their attention was now focussed on the black cash-box, which the young man had placed on the table, and was now in process of unlocking. The lid was lifted.

'Oo-oh!' said all the hundred and sixty-two simultaneously, as though they were looking at fireworks.

The young man took out a handful of tiny pillboxes. 'Now,' he said peremptorily, 'step forward, please. One at a time, and no shoving.'

One at a time, with no shoving, the twins stepped forward. First two males, then a female, then another male, then three females, then...

The Savage stood looking on. 'O brave new world, O brave new world...' In his mind the singing words seemed to change their tone. They had mocked him through his misery and remorse, mocked him with how hideous a note of cynical derision! Fiendishly laughing, they had insisted on the low squalor, the nauseous ugliness of the nightmare. Now, suddenly, they trumpeted a call to arms. 'O brave new world!' Miranda was proclaiming the possibility of loveliness, the possibility of transforming even the nightmare into something fine and noble. 'O brave new world!' It was a challenge, a command.

'No shoving there, now!' shouted the Deputy Sub-Bursar in a fury. He slammed down the lid of his cash-box. 'I shall stop the distribution unless I have good behaviour.'

The Deltas muttered, jostled one another a little, and then were still. The threat had been effective. Deprivation of soma--appalling thought!

'That's better' said the young man, and reopened his cash-box.

Linda had been a slave, Linda had died; others should live in freedom, and the world be made beautiful. A reparation, a duty. And suddenly it was luminously clear to the Savage what he must do; it was as though a shutter had been opened, a curtain drawn back.

'Now,' said the Deputy-Bursar.

Another khaki female stepped forward.

'Stop!' called the Savage in a loud and ringing voice. 'Stop!'

He pushed his way to the table; the Deltas stared at him with astonishment.

'Ford!' said the Deputy Sub-Bursar, below his breath. 'It's the Savage.' He felt scared.

'Listen, I beg you,' cried the Savage earnestly. 'Lend me your ears...' He had never spoken in public before, and found it very difficult to express what he wanted to say. 'Don't take that horrible stuff. It's poison, it's poison.'

'I say, Mr. Savage,' said the Deputy Sub-Bursar, smiling propitiatingly. 'Would you mind letting me...'

'Poison to soul as well as body.'

'Yes, but let me get on with my distribution, won't you? There's a good fellow.' With the cautious tenderness of one who strokes a notoriously vicious animal, he patted the Savage's arm. 'Just let me...'

'Never!' cried the Savage.

'But look here, old man...'

'Throw it all away, that horrible poison.'

The words 'Throw it all away' pierced through the enfolding layers of incomprehension to the quick of the Deltas' consciousness. An angry murmur went up from the crowd.

'I come to bring you freedom,' said the Savage, turning back towards the twins. 'I come...'

The Deputy Sub-Bursar heard no more; he had slipped out of the vestibule and was looking up a number in the telephone book.

****
'Not in his own rooms,' Bernard summed up. 'Not in mine, not in yours. Not at the Aphroditæum; not at the Centre or the College. Where can he have got to?'

Helmholtz shrugged his shoulders. They had come back from their work expecting to find the Savage waiting for them at one or other of their usual meeting-places, and there was no sign of the fellow. Which was annoying, as they had meant to nip across to Biarritz in Helmholtz's four-seater sporticopter. They'd be late for dinner if he didn't come soon.

'We'll give him five more minutes,' said Helmholtz. 'If he doesn't turn up by then, we'll...'

The ringing of the telephone bell interrupted him. He picked up the receiver. 'Hullo. Speaking.' Then, after a long interval of listening, 'Ford in Flivver!' he swore. 'I'll come at once.'

'What is it?' Bernard asked.

'A fellow I know at the Park Lane Hospital,' said Helmholtz. 'The Savage is there. Seems to have gone mad. Anyhow, it's urgent. Will you come with me?'

Together they hurried along the corridor to the lifts.

****
'But do you like being slaves?' the Savage was saying as they entered the Hospital. His face was flushed, his eyes bright with ardour and indignation. 'Do you like being babies? Yes, babies. Mewling and puking,' he added, exasperated by their bestial stupidity into throwing insults at those he had come to save. The insults bounced off their carapace of thick stupidity; they stared at him with a blank expression of dull and sullen resentment in their eyes. 'Yes, puking!' he fairly shouted. Grief and remorse, compassion and duty--all were forgotten now and, as it were, absorbed into an intense overpowering hatred of these less than human monsters. 'Don't you want to be free and men? Don't you even understand what manhood and freedom are?' Rage was making him fluent; the words came easily, in a rush. 'Don't you?' he repeated, but got no answer to his question. 'Very well, then,' he went on grimly. 'I'll teach you; I'll make you be free whether you want to or not.' And pushing open a window that looked on to the inner court of the Hospital, he began to throw the little pill-boxes of soma tablets in handfuls out into the area.

For a moment the khaki mob was silent, petrified, at the spectacle of this wanton sacrilege, with amazement and horror.

'He's mad,' whispered Bernard, staring with wide open eyes. 'They'll kill him. They'll...' A great shout suddenly went up from the mob; a wave of movement drove it menacingly towards the Savage. 'Ford help him!' said Bernard, and averted his eyes.

'Ford helps those who help themselves.' And with a laugh, actually a laugh of exultation, Helmholtz Watson pushed his way through the crowd.

'Free, free!' the Savage shouted, and with one hand continued to throw the soma into the area while, with the other, he punched the indistinguishable faces of his assailants. 'Free!' And suddenly there was Helmholtz at his side--'Good old Helmholtz!'--also punching--'Men at last!'--and in the interval also throwing the poison out by handfuls through the open window. 'Yes, men! men!' and there was no more poison left. He picked up the cash-box and showed them its black emptiness. 'You're free!'

Howling, the Deltas charged with a redoubled fury.

Hesitant on the fringes of the battle, 'They're done for,' said Bernard and, urged by a sudden impulse, ran forward to help them; then thought better of it and halted; then, ashamed, stepped forward again; then again thought better of it, and was standing in an agony of humiliated indecision--thinking that they might be killed if he didn't help them, and that he might be killed if he did--when (Ford be praised!), goggle-eyed and swine-snouted in their gas-masks, in ran the police.

Bernard dashed to meet them. He waved his arms; and it was action, he was doing something. He shouted 'Help!' several times, more and more loudly so as to give himself the illusion of helping. 'Help! Help! HELP!'

The policemen pushed him out of the way and got on with their work. Three men with spraying machines buckled to their shoulders pumped thick clouds of soma vapour into the air. Two more were busy round the portable Synthetic Music Box. Carrying water pistols charged with a powerful anæsthetic, four others had pushed their way into the crowd and were methodically laying out, squirt by squirt, the more ferocious of the fighters.

'Quick, quick!' yelled Bernard. 'They'll be killed if you don't hurry. They'll... Oh!' Annoyed by his chatter, one of the policemen had given him a shot from his water pistol. Bernard stood for a second or two wambling unsteadily on legs that seemed to have lost their bones, their tendons, their muscles, to have become mere sticks of jelly, and at last not even jelly--water: he tumbled in a heap on the floor.

Suddenly, from out of the Synthetic Music Box a Voice began to speak. The Voice of Reason, the Voice of Good Feeling. The sound-track roll was unwinding itself in Synthetic Anti-Riot Speech Number Two (Medium Strength). Straight from the depths of a non-existent heart, 'My friends, my friends!' said the Voice so pathetically, with a note of such infinitely tender reproach that, behind their gas-masks, even the policemen's eyes were momentarily dimmed with tears, 'what is the meaning of this? Why aren't you all being happy and good together. Happy and good,' the Voice repeated. 'At peace, at peace.' It trembled, sank into a whisper and momentarily expired. 'Oh, I do want you to be happy,' it began, with a yearning earnestness. 'I do so want you to be good! Please, please be good and...'

Two minutes later the Voice and the soma vapour had produced their effect. In tears, the Deltas were kissing and hugging one another--half a dozen twins at a time in a comprehensive embrace. Even Helmholtz and the Savage were almost crying. A fresh supply of pill-boxes was brought in from the Bursary; a new distribution was hastily made and, to the sound of the Voice's richly affectionate, baritone valedictions, the twins dispersed, blubbering as though their hearts would break. 'Good-bye, my dearest, dearest friends, Ford keep you! Good-bye, my dearest, dearest friends. Ford keep you. Good-bye, my dearest, dearest...'

When the last of the Deltas had gone the policeman switched off the current. The angelic Voice fell silent.

'Will you come quietly?' asked the Sergeant, 'or must we anæsthetize?' He pointed his water pistol menacingly.

'Oh, we'll come quietly,' the Savage answered, dabbing alternately a cut lip, a scratched neck, and a bitten left hand.

Still keeping his handkerchief to his bleeding nose, Helmholtz nodded in confirmation.

Awake and having recovered the use of his legs, Bernard had chosen this moment to move as inconspicuously as he could towards the door.

'Hi, you there,' called the Sergeant, and a swine-masked policeman hurried across the room and laid a hand on the young man's shoulder.

Bernard turned with an expression of indignant innocence. Escaping? He hadn't dreamed of such a thing. 'Though what on earth you want me for,' he said to the Sergeant, 'I really can't imagine.'

'You're a friend of the prisoners, aren't you?'

'Well...' said Bernard, and hesitated. No, he really couldn't deny it. 'Why shouldn't I be?' he asked.

'Come on, then,' said the Sergeant, and led the way towards the door and the waiting police car.


Chapter XVI

The room into which the three were ushered was the Controller's study.

'His fordship will be down in a moment.' The Gamma butler left them to themselves.

Helmholtz laughed aloud.

'It's more like a caffeine-solution party than a trial,' he said, and let himself fall into the most luxurious of the pneumatic arm-chairs. 'Cheer up, Bernard,' he added, catching sight of his friend's green unhappy face. But Bernard would not be cheered; without answering, without even looking at Helmholtz, he went and sat down on the most uncomfortable chair in the room, carefully chosen in the obscure hope of somehow deprecating the wrath of the higher powers.

The Savage meanwhile wandered restlessly round the room, peering with a vague superficial inquisitiveness at the books in the shelves, at the sound-track rolls and the reading-machine bobbins in their numbered pigeon-holes. On the table under the window lay a massive volume bound in limp black leather-surrogate, and stamped with large golden T's. He picked it up and opened it. MY LIFE AND WORK, BY OUR FORD. The book had been published at Detroit by the Society for the Propagation of Fordian Knowledge. Idly he turned the pages, read a sentence here, a paragraph there, and had just come to the conclusion that the book didn't interest him, when the door opened, and the Resident World Controller for Western Europe walked briskly into the room.

Mustapha Mond shook hands with all three of them; but it was to the Savage that he addressed himself. 'So you don't much like civilization, Mr. Savage,' he said.

The Savage looked at him. He had been prepared to lie, to bluster, to remain sullenly unresponsive; but, reassured by the good-humoured intelligence of the Controller's face, he decided to tell the truth, straightforwardly. 'No.' He shook his head.

Bernard started and looked horrified. What would the Controller think? To be labelled as the friend of a man who said that he didn't like civilization--said it openly and, of all people, to the Controller--it was terrible. 'But, John,' he began. A look from Mustapha Mond reduced him to an abject silence.

'Of course,' the Savage went on to admit, 'there are some very nice things. All that music in the air, for instance...'

'Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about my ears, and sometimes voices.'

The Savage's face lit up with a sudden pleasure. 'Have you read it too?' he asked. 'I thought nobody knew about that book here, in England.'

'Almost nobody. I'm one of the very few. It's prohibited, you see. But as I make the laws here, I can also break them. With impunity, Mr. Marx,' he added, turning to Bernard. 'Which I'm afraid you can't do.'

Bernard sank into a yet more hopeless misery.

'But why is it prohibited?' asked the Savage. In the excitement of meeting a man who had read Shakespeare he had momentarily forgotten everything else.

The Controller shrugged his shoulders. 'Because it's old; that's the chief reason. We haven't any use for old things here.'

'Even when they're beautiful?'

'Particularly when they're beautiful. Beauty's attractive, and we don't want people to be attracted by old things. We want them to like the new ones.'

'But the new ones are so stupid and horrible. Those plays, where there's nothing but helicopters flying about and you feel the people kissing.' He made a grimace. 'Goats and monkeys!' Only in Othello's words could he find an adequate vehicle for his contempt and hatred.

'Nice tame animals, anyhow,' the Controller murmured parenthetically.

'Why don't you let them see Othello instead?'

'I've told you; it's old. Besides, they couldn't understand it.'

Yes, that was true. He remembered how Helmholtz had laughed at Romeo and Juliet. 'Well, then,' he said, after a pause, 'something new that's like Othello, and that they could understand.'

'That's what we've all been wanting to write,' said Helmholtz, breaking a long silence.

'And it's what you never will write,' said the Controller. 'Because, if it were really like Othello nobody could understand it, however new it might be. And if it were new, it couldn't possibly be like Othello.'

'Why not?'

'Yes, why not?' Helmholtz repeated. He too was forgetting the unpleasant realities of the situation. Green with anxiety and apprehension, only Bernard remembered them; the others ignored him. 'Why not?'

'Because our world is not the same as Othello's world. You can't make flivvers without steel--and you can't make tragedies without social instability. The world's stable now. People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can't get. They're well off; they're safe; they're never ill; they're not afraid of death; they're blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they're plagued with no mothers or fathers; they've got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they're so conditioned that they practically can't help behaving as they ought to behave. And if anything should go wrong, there's soma. Which you go and chuck out of the window in the name of liberty, Mr. Savage. Liberty!' He laughed. 'Expecting Deltas to know what liberty is! And now expecting them to understand Othello! My good boy!'

The Savage was silent for a little. 'All the same,' he insisted obstinately, 'Othello's good, Othello's better than those feelies.'

'Of course it is,' the Controller agreed. 'But that's the price we have to pay for stability. You've got to choose between happiness and what people used to call high art. We've sacrificed the high art. We have the feelies and the scent organ instead.'

'But they don't mean anything.'

'They mean themselves; they mean a lot of agreeable sensations to the audience.'

'But they're... they're told by an idiot.'

The Controller laughed. 'You're not being very polite to your friend, Mr. Watson. One of our most distinguished Emotional Engineers...'

'But he's right,' said Helmholtz gloomily. 'Because it is idiotic. Writing when there's nothing to say...'

'Precisely. But that requires the most enormous ingenuity. You're making flivvers out of the absolute minimum of steel--works of art out of practically nothing but pure sensation.'

The Savage shook his head. 'It all seems to me quite horrible.'

'Of course it does. Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.'

'I suppose not,' said the Savage after a silence. 'But need it be quite so bad as those twins?' He passed his hand over his eyes as though he were trying to wipe away the remembered image of those long rows of identical midgets at the assembling tables, those queued-up twin-herds at the entrance to the Brentford monorail station, those human maggots swarming round Linda's bed of death, the endlessly repeated face of his assailants. He looked at his bandaged left hand and shuddered. 'Horrible!'

'But how useful! I see you don't like our Bokanovsky Groups; but, I assure you, they're the foundation on which everything else is built. They're the gyroscope that stabilizes the rocket plane of state on its unswerving course.' The deep voice thrillingly vibrated; the gesticulating hand implied all space and the onrush of the irresistible machine. Mustapha Mond's oratory was almost up to synthetic standards.

'I was wondering,' said the Savage, 'why you had them at all--seeing that you can get whatever you want out of those bottles. Why don't you make everybody an Alpha Double Plus while you're about it?'

Mustapha Mond laughed. 'Because we have no wish to have our throats cut,' he answered. 'We believe in happiness and stability. A society of Alphas couldn't fail to be unstable and miserable. Imagine a factory staffed by Alphas--that is to say by separate and unrelated individuals of good heredity and conditioned so as to be capable (within limits) of making a free choice and assuming responsibilities. Imagine it!' he repeated.

The Savage tried to imagine it, not very successfully.

'It's an absurdity. An Alpha-decanted, Alpha-conditioned man would go mad if he had to do Epsilon Semi-Moron work--go mad, or start smashing things up. Alphas can be completely socialized--but only on condition that you make them do Alpha work. Only an Epsilon can be expected to make Epsilon sacrifices, for the good reason that for him they aren't sacrifices; they're the line of least resistance. His conditioning has laid down rails along which he's got to run. He can't help himself; he's foredoomed. Even after decanting, he's still inside a bottle--an invisible bottle of infantile and embryonic fixations. Each one of us, of course,' the Controller meditatively continued, 'goes through life inside a bottle. But if we happen to be Alphas, our bottles are, relatively speaking, enormous. We should suffer acutely if we were confined in a narrower space. You cannot pour upper-caste champagne-surrogate into lower-caste bottles. It's obvious theoretically. But it has also been proved in actual practice. The result of the Cyprus experiment was convincing.'

'What was that?' asked the Savage.

Mustapha Mond smiled. 'Well, you can call it an experiment in rebottling if you like. It began in A.F. 473. The Controllers had the island of Cyprus cleared of all its existing inhabitants and re-colonized with a specially prepared batch of twenty-two thousand Alphas. All agricultural and industrial equipment was handed over to them and they were left to manage their own affairs. The result exactly fulfilled all the theoretical predictions. The land wasn't properly worked; there were strikes in all the factories; the laws were set at naught, orders disobeyed; all the people detailed for a spell of low-grade work were perpetually intriguing for high-grade jobs, and all the people with high-grade jobs were counter-intriguing at all costs to stay where they were. Within six years they were having a first-class civil war. When nineteen out of the twenty-two thousand had been killed, the survivors unanimously petitioned the World Controllers to resume the government of the island. Which they did. And that was the end of the only society of Alphas that the world has ever seen.'

The Savage sighed, profoundly.

'The optimum population,' said Mustapha Mond, 'is modelled on the iceberg--eight-ninths below the water line, one-ninth above.'

'And they're happy below the water line?'

'Happier than above it. Happier than your friends here, for example.' He pointed.

'In spite of that awful work?'

'Awful? They don't find it so. On the contrary, they like it. It's light, it's childishly simple. No strain on the mind or the muscles. Seven and a half hours of mild, unexhausting labour, and then the soma ration and games and unrestricted copulation and the feelies. What more can they ask for? True,' he added, 'they might ask for shorter hours. And of course we could give them shorter hours. Technically, it would be perfectly simple to reduce all lower-caste working hours to three or four a day. But would they be any the happier for that? No, they wouldn't. The experiment was tried, more than a century and a half ago. The whole of Ireland was put on to the four-hour day. What was the result? Unrest and a large increase in the consumption of soma; that was all. Those three and a half hours of extra leisure were so far from being a source of happiness, that people felt constrained to take a holiday from them. The Inventions Office is stuffed with plans for labour-saving processes. Thousands of them.' Mustapha Mond made a lavish gesture. 'And why don't we put them into execution? For the sake of the labourers; it would be sheer cruelty to afflict them with excessive leisure. It's the same with agriculture. We could synthesize every morsel of food, if we wanted to. But we don't. We prefer to keep a third of the population on the land. For their own sakes--because it takes longer to get food out of the land than out of a factory. Besides, we have our stability to think of. We don't want to change. Every change is a menace to stability. That's another reason why we're so chary of applying new inventions. Every discovery in pure science is potentially subversive; even science must sometimes be treated as a possible enemy. Yes, even science.'

Science? The Savage frowned. He knew the word. But what it exactly signified he could not say. Shakespeare and the old men of the pueblo had never mentioned science, and from Linda he had only gathered the vaguest hints: science was something you made helicopters with, something that caused you to laugh at the Corn Dances, something that prevented you from being wrinkled and losing your teeth. He made a desperate effort to take the Controller's meaning.

'Yes,' Mustapha Mond was saying, 'that's another item in the cost of stability. It isn't only art that's incompatible with happiness; it's also science. Science is dangerous; we have to keep it most carefully chained and muzzled.'

'What?' said Helmholtz, in astonishment. 'But we're always saying that science is everything. It's a hypnopædic platitude.'

'Three times a week between thirteen and seventeen,' put in Bernard.

'And all the science propaganda we do at the College...'

'Yes; but what sort of science?' asked Mustapha Mond sarcastically. 'You've had no scientific training, so you can't judge. I was a pretty good physicist in my time. Too good--good enough to realize that all our science is just a cookery book, with an orthodox theory of cooking that nobody's allowed to question, and a list of recipes that mustn't be added to except by special permission from the head cook. I'm the head cook now. But I was an inquisitive young scullion once. I started doing a bit of cooking on my own. Unorthodox cooking, illicit cooking. A bit of real science, in fact.' He was silent.

'What happened?' asked Helmholtz Watson.

The Controller sighed. 'Very nearly what's going to happen to you young men. I was on the point of being sent to an island.'

The words galvanized Bernard into a violent and unseemly activity. 'Send me to an island?' He jumped up, ran across the room, and stood gesticulating in front of the Controller. 'You can't send me. I haven't done anything. It was the others. I swear it was the others.' He pointed accusingly to Helmholtz and the Savage. 'Oh, please don't send me to Iceland. I promise I'll do what I ought to do. Give me another chance. Please give me another chance.' The tears began to flow. 'I tell you, it's their fault,' he sobbed. 'And not to Iceland. Oh, please, your fordship, please...' And in a paroxysm of abjection he threw himself on his knees before the Controller. Mustapha Mond tried to make him get up; but Bernard persisted in his grovelling; the stream of words poured out inexhaustibly. In the end the Controller had to ring for his fourth secretary.

'Bring three men,' he ordered, 'and take Mr. Marx into a bedroom. Give him a good soma vaporization and then put him to bed and leave him.'

The fourth secretary went out and returned with three green-uniformed twin footmen. Still shouting and sobbing, Bernard was carried out.

'One would think he was going to have his throat cut,' said the Controller, as the door closed. 'Whereas, if he had the smallest sense, he'd understand that his punishment is really a reward. He's being sent to an island. That's to say, he's being sent to a place where he'll meet the most interesting set of men and women to be found anywhere in the world. All the people who, for one reason or another, have got too self-consciously individual to fit into community-life. All the people who aren't satisfied with orthodoxy, who've got independent ideas of their own. Every one, in a word, who's any one. I almost envy you, Mr. Watson.'

Helmholtz laughed. 'Then why aren't you on an island yourself?'

'Because, finally, I preferred this,' the Controller answered. 'I was given the choice: to be sent to an island, where I could have got on with my pure science, or to be taken on to the Controllers' Council with the prospect of succeeding in due course to an actual Controllership. I chose this and let the science go.' After a little silence, 'Sometimes,' he added, 'I rather regret the science. Happiness is a hard master--particularly other people's happiness. A much harder master, if one isn't conditioned to accept it unquestioningly, than truth.' He sighed, fell silent again, then continued in a brisker tone. 'Well, duty's duty. One can't consult one's own preferences. I'm interested in truth, I like science. But truth's a menace, science is a public danger. As dangerous as it's been beneficent. It has given us the stablest equilibrium in history. China's was hopelessly insecure by comparison; even the primitive matriarchies weren't steadier than we are. Thanks, I repeat, to science. But we can't allow science to undo its own good work. That's why we so carefully limit the scope of its researches--that's why I almost got sent to an island. We don't allow it to deal with any but the most immediate problems of the moment. All other enquiries are most sedulously discouraged. It's curious,' he went on after a little pause, 'to read what people in the time of Our Ford used to write about scientific progress. They seemed to have imagined that it could be allowed to go on indefinitely, regardless of everything else. Knowledge was the highest good, truth the supreme value; all the rest was secondary and subordinate. True, ideas were beginning to change even then. Our Ford himself did a great deal to shift the emphasis from truth and beauty to comfort and happiness. Mass production demanded the shift. Universal happiness keeps the wheels steadily turning; truth and beauty can't. And, of course, whenever the masses seized political power, then it was happiness rather than truth and beauty that mattered. Still, in spite of everything, unrestricted scientific research was still permitted. People still went on talking about truth and beauty as though they were the sovereign goods. Right up to the time of the Nine Years' War. That made them change their tune all right. What's the point of truth or beauty or knowledge when the anthrax bombs are popping all around you? That was when science first began to be controlled--after the Nine Years' War. People were ready to have even their appetites controlled then. Anything for a quiet life. We've gone on controlling ever since. It hasn't been very good for truth, of course. But it's been very good for happiness. One can't have something for nothing. Happiness has got to be paid for. You're paying for it, Mr. Watson--paying because you happen to be too much interested in beauty. I was too much interested in truth; I paid too.'

'But you didn't go to an island,' said the Savage, breaking a long silence.

The Controller smiled. 'That's how I paid. By choosing to serve happiness. Other people's--not mine. It's lucky,' he added, after a pause, 'that there are such a lot of islands in the world. I don't know what we should do without them. Put you all in the lethal chamber, I suppose. By the way, Mr. Watson, would you like a tropical climate? The Marquesas, for example; or Samoa? Or something rather more bracing?'

Helmholtz rose from his pneumatic chair. 'I should like a thoroughly bad climate,' he answered. 'I believe one would write better if the climate were bad. If there were a lot of wind and storms, for example...'

The Controller nodded his approbation. 'I like your spirit, Mr. Watson. I like it very much indeed. As much as I officially disapprove of it.' He smiled. 'What about the Falkland Islands?'

'Yes, I think that will do,' Helmholtz answered. 'And now, if you don't mind, I'll go and see how poor Bernard's getting on.'


Chapter XVII

'Art, science--you seem to have paid a fairly high price for your happiness,' said the Savage, when they were alone. 'Anything else?'

'Well, religion, of course,' replied the Controller. 'There used to be something called God--before the Nine Years' War. But I was forgetting; you know all about God, I suppose.'

'Well...' The Savage hesitated. He would have liked to say something about solitude, about night, about the mesa lying pale under the moon, about the precipice, the plunge into shadowy darkness, about death. He would have liked to speak; but there were no words. Not even in Shakespeare.

The Controller, meanwhile, had crossed to the other side of the room and was unlocking a large safe let into the wall between the bookshelves. The heavy door swung open. Rummaging in the darkness within, 'It's a subject,' he said, 'that has always had a great interest for me.' He pulled out a thick black volume. 'You've never read this, for example.'

The Savage took it. 'The Holy Bible, containing the Old and New Testaments,' he read aloud from the title-page.

'Nor this.' It was a small book and had lost its cover.

'The Imitation of Christ.'

'Nor this.' He handed out another volume.

'The Varieties of Religious Experience. By William James.'

'And I've got plenty more,' Mustapha Mond continued, resuming his seat. 'A whole collection of pornographic old books. God in the safe and Ford on the shelves.' He pointed with a laugh to his avowed library--to the shelves of books, the racks full of reading-machine bobbins and sound-track rolls.

'But if you know about God, why don't you tell them?' asked the Savage indignantly. 'Why don't you give them these books about God?'

'For the same reason as we don't give them Othello: they're old; they're about God hundreds of years ago. Not about God now.'

'But God doesn't change.'

'Men do, though.'

'What difference does that make?'

'All the difference in the world,' said Mustapha Mond. He got up again and walked to the safe. 'There was a man called Cardinal Newman,' he said. 'A cardinal,' he exclaimed parenthetically, 'was a kind of Arch-Community-Songster.'

'"I, Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal." I've read about them in Shakespeare.'

'Of course you have. Well, as I was saying, there was a man called Cardinal Newman. Ah, here's the book.' He pulled it out. 'And while I'm about it I'll take this one too. It's by a man called Maine de Biran. He was a philosopher, if you know what that was.'

'A man who dreams of fewer things than there are in heaven and earth,' said the Savage promptly.

'Quite so. I'll read you one of the things he did dream of in a moment. Meanwhile, listen to what this old Arch-Community-Songster said.' He opened the book at the place marked by a slip of paper and began to read. '"We are not our own any more than what we possess is our own. We did not make ourselves, we cannot be supreme over ourselves. We are not our own masters. We are God's property. Is it not our happiness thus to view the matter? Is it any happiness, or any comfort, to consider that we are our own? It may be thought so by the young and prosperous. These may think it a great thing to have everything, as they suppose, their own way--to depend on no one--to have to think of nothing out of sight, to be without the irksomeness of continual acknowledgment, continual prayer, continual reference of what they do to the will of another. But as time goes on, they, as all men, will find that independence was not made for man--that it is an unnatural state--will do for a while, but will not carry us on safely to the end..."' Mustapha Mond paused, put down the first book and, picking up the other, turned over the pages. 'Take this, for example,' he said, and in his deep voice once more began to read: '"A man grows old; he feels in himself that radical sense of weakness, of listlessness, of discomfort, which accompanies the advance of age; and, feeling thus, imagines himself merely sick, lulling his fears with the notion that this distressing condition is due to some particular cause, from which, as from an illness, he hopes to recover. Vain imaginings! That sickness is old age; and a horrible disease it is. They say that it is the fear of death and of what comes after death that makes men turn to religion as they advance in years. But my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart from any such terrors or imaginings, the religious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older; to develop because, as the passions grow calm, as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and less excitable, our reason becomes less troubled in its working, less obscured by the images, desires and distractions, in which it used to be absorbed; whereupon God emerges as from behind a cloud; our soul feels, sees, turns towards the source of all light; turns naturally and inevitably; for now that all that gave to the world of sensations its life and charm has begun to leak away from us, now that phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from within or from without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, something that will never play us false--a reality, an absolute and everlasting truth. Yes, we inevitably turn to God; for this religious sentiment is of its nature so pure, so delightful to the soul that experiences it, that it makes up to us for all our other losses."' Mustapha Mond shut the book and leaned back in his chair. 'One of the numerous things in heaven and earth that these philosophers didn't dream about was this' (he waved his hand), 'us, the modern world. "You can only be independent of God while you've got youth and prosperity; independence won't take you safely to the end." Well, we've now got youth and prosperity right up to the end. What follows? Evidently, that we can be independent of God. "The religious sentiment will compensate us for all our losses." But there aren't any losses for us to compensate; religious sentiment is superfluous. And why should we go hunting for a substitute for youthful desires, when youthful desires never fail? A substitute for distractions, when we go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last? What need have we of repose when our minds and bodies continue to delight in activity? of consolation, when we have soma? of something immovable, when there is the social order?'

'Then you think there is no God?'

'No, I think there quite probably is one.'

'Then why?...'

Mustapha Mond checked him. 'But he manifests himself in different ways to different men. In pre-modern times he manifested himself as the being that's described in these books. Now...'

'How does he manifest himself now?' asked the Savage.

'Well, he manifests himself as an absence; as though he weren't there at all.'

'That's your fault.'

'Call it the fault of civilization. God isn't compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness. You must make your choice. Our civilization has chosen machinery and medicine and happiness. That's why I have to keep these books locked up in the safe. They're smut. People would be shocked if...'

The Savage interrupted him. 'But isn't it natural to feel there's a God?'

'You might as well ask if it's natural to do up one's trousers with zippers,' said the Controller sarcastically. 'You remind me of another of those old fellows called Bradley. He defined philosophy as the finding of bad reason for what one believes by instinct. As if one believed anything by instinct! One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them. Finding bad reasons for what one believes for other bad reasons--that's philosophy. People believe in God because they've been conditioned to believe in God.'

'But all the same,' insisted the Savage, 'it is natural to believe in God when you're alone--quite alone, in the night, thinking about death...'

'But people never are alone now,' said Mustapha Mond. 'We make them hate solitude; and we arrange their lives so that it's almost impossible for them ever to have it.'

The Savage nodded gloomily. At Malpais he had suffered because they had shut him out from the communal activities of the pueblo, in civilized London he was suffering because he could never escape from those communal activities, never be quietly alone.

'Do you remember that bit in King Lear?' said the Savage at last: '"The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us; the dark and vicious place where thee he got cost him his eyes," and Edmund answers--you remember, he's wounded, he's dying--"Thou hast spoken right; 'tis true. The wheel is come full circle; I am here." What about that, now? Doesn't there seem to be a God managing things, punishing, rewarding?'

'Well, does there?' questioned the Controller in his turn. 'You can indulge in any number of pleasant vices with a freemartin and run no risks of having your eyes put out by your son's mistress. "The wheel is come full circle; I am here." But where would Edmund be nowadays? Sitting in a pneumatic chair, with his arm round a girl's waist, sucking away at his sex-hormone chewing-gum and looking at the feelies. The gods are just. No doubt. But their code of law is dictated, in the last resort, by the people who organize society; Providence takes its cue from men.'

'Are you sure?' asked the Savage. 'Are you quite sure that the Edmund in that pneumatic chair hasn't been just as heavily punished as the Edmund who's wounded and bleeding to death? The gods are just. Haven't they used his pleasant vices as an instrument to degrade him?'

'Degrade him from what position? As a happy, hard-working, goods-consuming citizen he's perfect. Of course, if you choose some other standard than ours, then perhaps you might say he was degraded. But you've got to stick to one set of postulates. You can't play Electro-magnetic Golf according to the rules of Centrifugal Bumble-puppy.'

'But value dwells not in particular will,' said the Savage. 'It holds his estimate and dignity as well wherein 'tis precious of itself as in the prizer.'

'Come, come,' protested Mustapha Mond, 'that's going rather far, isn't it?'

'If you allowed yourselves to think of God, you wouldn't allow yourselves to be degraded by pleasant vices. You'd have a reason for bearing things patiently, for doing things with courage. I've seen it with the Indians.'

'I'm sure you have,' said Mustapha Mond. 'But then we aren't Indians. There isn't any need for a civilized man to bear anything that's seriously unpleasant. And as for doing things--Ford forbid that he should get the idea into his head. It would upset the whole social order if men started doing things on their own.'

'What about self-denial, then? If you had a God, you'd have a reason for self-denial.'

'But industrial civilization is only possible when there's no self-denial. Self-indulgence up to the very limits imposed by hygiene and economics. Otherwise the wheels stop turning.'

'You'd have a reason for chastity!' said the Savage, blushing a little as he spoke the words.

'But chastity means passion, chastity means neurasthenia. And passion and neurasthenia mean instability. And instability means the end of civilization. You can't have a lasting civilization without plenty of pleasant vices.'

'But God's the reason for everything noble and fine and heroic. If you had a God...'

'My dear young friend,' said Mustapha Mond, 'civilization has absolutely no need of nobility or heroism. These things are symptoms of political inefficiency. In a properly organized society like ours, nobody has any opportunities for being noble or heroic. Conditions have got to be thoroughly unstable before the occasion can arise. Where there are wars, where there are divided allegiances, where there are temptations to be resisted, objects of love to be fought for or defended--there, obviously, nobility and heroism have some sense. But there aren't any wars nowadays. The greatest care is taken to prevent you from loving any one too much. There's no such thing as a divided allegiance; you're so conditioned that you can't help doing what you ought to do. And what you ought to do is on the whole so pleasant, so many of the natural impulses are allowed free play, that there really aren't any temptations to resist. And if ever, by some unlucky chance, anything unpleasant should somehow happen, why, there's always soma to give you a holiday from the facts. And there's always soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your enemies, to make you patient and long-suffering. In the past you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. Now, you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are. Anybody can be virtuous now. You can carry at least half your morality about in a bottle. Christianity without tears--that's what soma is.'

'But the tears are necessary. Don't you remember what Othello said? "If after every tempest come such calms, may the winds blow till they have wakened death." There's a story one of the old Indians used to tell us, about the Girl of Mátsaki. The young men who wanted to marry her had to do a morning's hoeing in her garden. It seemed easy; but there were flies and mosquitoes, magic ones. Most of the young men simply couldn't stand the biting and stinging. But the one that could--he got the girl.'

'Charming! But in civilized countries,' said the Controller, 'you can have girls without hoeing for them; and there aren't any flies or mosquitoes to sting you. We got rid of them all centuries ago.'

The Savage nodded, frowning. 'You got rid of them. Yes, that's just like you. Getting rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with it. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them.... But you don't do either. Neither suffer nor oppose. You just abolish the slings and arrows. It's too easy.'

He was suddenly silent, thinking of his mother. In her room on the thirty-seventh floor, Linda had floated in a sea of singing lights and perfumed caresses--floated away, out of space, out of time, out of the prison of her memories, her habits, her aged and bloated body. And Tomakin, ex-Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning, Tomakin was still on holiday--on holiday from humiliation and pain, in a world where he could not hear those words, that derisive laughter, could not see that hideous face, feel those moist and flabby arms round his neck, in a beautiful world...

'What you need,' the Savage went on, 'is something with tears for a change. Nothing costs enough here.'

('Twelve and a half million dollars,' Henry Foster had protested when the Savage told him that. 'Twelve and a half million--that's what the new Conditioning Centre cost. Not a cent less.')

'Exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune, death and danger dare, even for an egg-shell. Isn't there something in that?' he asked, looking up at Mustapha Mond. 'Quite apart from God--though of course God would be a reason for it. Isn't there something in living dangerously?'

'There's a great deal in it,' the Controller replied. 'Men and women must have their adrenals stimulated from time to time.'

'What?' questioned the Savage, uncomprehending.

'It's one of the conditions of perfect health. That's why we've made the V.P.S. treatments compulsory.'

'V.P.S.?'

'Violent Passion Surrogate. Regularly once a month. We flood the whole system with adrenin. It's the complete physiological equivalent of fear and rage. All the tonic effects of murdering Desdemona and being murdered by Othello, without any of the inconveniences.'

'But I like the inconveniences.'

'We don't,' said the Controller. 'We prefer to do things comfortably.'

'But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.'

'In fact,' said Mustapha Mond, 'you're claiming the right to be unhappy.'

'All right, then,' said the Savage defiantly, 'I'm claiming the right to be unhappy.'

'Not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to have syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat; the right to be lousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen to-morrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind.'

There was a long silence.

'I claim them all,' said the Savage at last.

Mustapha Mond shrugged his shoulders. 'You're welcome,' he said.


Chapter XVIII

The door was ajar; they entered.

'John!'

From the bathroom came an unpleasant and characteristic sound.

'Is there anything the matter?' Helmholtz called.

There was no answer. The unpleasant sound was repeated, twice; there was silence. Then, with a click, the bathroom door opened and, very pale, the Savage emerged.

'I say,' Helmholtz exclaimed solicitously, 'you do look ill, John!'

'Did you eat something that didn't agree with you?' asked Bernard.

The Savage nodded. 'I ate civilization.'

'What?'

'It poisoned me; I was defiled. And then,' he added, in a lower tone, 'I ate my own wickedness.'

'Yes, but what exactly?... I mean, just now you were...'

'Now I am purified,' said the Savage. 'I drank some mustard and warm water.'

The others stared at him in astonishment. 'Do you mean to say that you were doing it on purpose?' asked Bernard.

'That's how the Indians always purify themselves.' He sat down and, sighing, passed his hand across his forehead. 'I shall rest for a few minutes,' he said. 'I'm rather tired.'

'Well, I'm not surprised,' said Helmholtz. After a silence, 'We've come to say good-bye,' he went on in another tone. 'We're off to-morrow morning.'

'Yes, we're off to-morrow,' said Bernard, on whose face the Savage remarked a new expression of determined resignation. 'And by the way, John,' he continued, leaning forward in his chair and laying a hand on the Savage's knee, 'I want to say how sorry I am about everything that happened yesterday.' He blushed. 'How ashamed,' he went on, in spite of the unsteadiness of his voice, 'how really...'

The Savage cut him short and, taking his hand, affectionately pressed it.

'Helmholtz was wonderful to me,' Bernard resumed, after a little pause. 'If it hadn't been for him, I should...'

'Now, now,' Helmholtz protested.

There was a silence. In spite of their sadness--because of it, even; for their sadness was the symptom of their love for one another--the three young men were happy.

'I went to see the Controller this morning,' said the Savage at last.

'What for?'

'To ask if I mightn't go to the islands with you.'

'And what did he say?' asked Helmholtz eagerly.

The Savage shook his head. 'He wouldn't let me.'

'Why not?'

'He said he wanted to go on with the experiment. But I'm damned,' the Savage added, with sudden fury, 'I'm damned if I'll go on being experimented with. Not for all the Controllers in the world. I shall go away to-morrow too.'

'But where?' the others asked in unison.

The Savage shrugged his shoulders. 'Anywhere. I don't care. So long as I can be alone.'

****
From Guildford the down-line followed the Wey valley to Godalming, then, over Milford and Witley, proceeded to Haslemere and on through Petersfield towards Portsmouth. Roughly parallel to it, the up-line passed over Worplesden, Tongham, Puttenham, Elstead and Grayshott. Between the Hog's Back and Hindhead there were points where the two lines were not more than six or seven kilometres apart. The distance was too small for careless flyers--particularly at night and when they had taken half a gramme too much. There had been accidents. Serious ones. It had been decided to deflect the up-line a few kilometres to the west. Between Grayshott and Tongham four abandoned air-lighthouses marked the course of the old Portsmouth-to-London road. The skies above them were silent and deserted. It was over Selborne, Borden and Farnham that the helicopters now ceaselessly hummed and roared.

The Savage had chosen as his hermitage the old lighthouse which stood on the crest of the hill between Puttenham and Elstead. The building was of ferro-concrete and in excellent condition--almost too comfortable, the Savage had thought when he first explored the place, almost too civilizedly luxurious. He pacified his conscience by promising himself a compensatingly harder self-discipline, purifications the more complete and thorough. His first night in the hermitage was, deliberately, a sleepless one. He spent the hours on his knees praying, now to that Heaven from which the guilty Claudius had begged forgiveness, now in Zuñi to Awonawilona, now to Jesus and Pookong, now to his own guardian animal, the eagle. From time to time he stretched out his arms as though he were on the cross, and held them thus through long minutes of an ache that gradually increased till it became a tremulous and excruciating agony; held them, in voluntary crucifixion, while he repeated, through clenched teeth (the sweat, meanwhile, pouring down his face), 'Oh, forgive me! Oh, make me pure! Oh, help me to be good!' again and again, till he was on the point of fainting from the pain.

When morning came, he felt he had earned the right to inhabit the lighthouse: yes, even though there still was glass in most of the windows, even though the view from the platform was so fine. For the very reason why he had chosen the lighthouse had become almost instantly a reason for going somewhere else. He had decided to live there because the view was so beautiful, because, from his vantage point, he seemed to be looking out on to the incarnation of a divine being. But who was he to be pampered with the daily and hourly sight of loveliness? Who was he to be living in the visible presence of God? All he deserved to live in was some filthy sty, some blind hole in the ground. Stiff and still aching after his long night of pain, but for that very reason inwardly reassured, he climbed up to the platform of his tower, he looked out over the bright sunrise world which he had regained the right to inhabit. On the north the view was bounded by the long chalk ridge of the Hog's Back, from behind whose eastern extremity rose the towers of the seven skyscrapers which constituted Guildford. Seeing them, the Savage made a grimace; but he was to become reconciled to them in course of time; for at night they twinkled gaily with geometrical constellations, or else, flood-lighted, pointed their luminous fingers (with a gesture whose significance nobody in England but the Savage now understood) solemnly towards the plumbless mysteries of heaven.

In the valley which separated the Hog's Back from the sandy hill on which the lighthouse stood, Puttenham was a modest little village nine stories high, with silos, a poultry farm, and a small vitamin-D factory. On the other side of the lighthouse, towards the south, the ground fell away in long slopes of heather to a chain of ponds.

Beyond them, above the intervening woods, rose the fourteen-story tower of Elstead. Dim in the hazy English air, Hindhead and Selborne invited the eye into a blue romantic distance. But it was not alone the distance that had attracted the Savage to his lighthouse; the near was as seductive as the far. The woods, the open stretches of heather and yellow gorse, the clumps of Scotch firs, the shining ponds with their overhanging birch trees, their water lilies, their beds of rushes--these were beautiful and, to an eye accustomed to the aridities of the American desert, astonishing. And then the solitude! Whole days passed during which he never saw a human being. The lighthouse was only a quarter of an hour's flight from the Charing-T Tower; but the hills of Malpais were hardly more deserted than this Surrey heath. The crowds that daily left London left it only to play Electro-magnetic Golf or Tennis. Puttenham possessed no links; the nearest Riemann-surfaces were at Guildford. Flowers and a landscape were the only attractions here. And so, as there was no good reason for coming, nobody came. During the first days the Savage lived alone and undisturbed.

Of the money which, on his first arrival, John had received for his personal expenses, most had been spent on his equipment. Before leaving London he had bought four viscose-woollen blankets, rope and string, nails, glue, a few tools, matches (though he intended in due course to make a fire drill), some pots and pans, two dozen packets of seeds, and ten kilogrammes of wheat flour. 'No, not synthetic starch and cotton-waste flour-substitute,' he had insisted. 'Even though it is more nourishing.' But when it came to pan-glandular biscuits and vitaminized beef-surrogate, he had not been able to resist the shopman's persuasion. Looking at the tins now, he bitterly reproached himself for his weakness. Loathsome civilized stuff! He had made up his mind that he would never eat it, even if he were starving. 'That'll teach them,' he thought vindictively. It would also teach him.

He counted his money. The little that remained would be enough, he hoped, to tide him over the winter. By next spring, his garden would be producing enough to make him independent of the outside world. Meanwhile, there would always be game. He had seen plenty of rabbits, and there were water-fowl on the ponds. He set to work at once to make a bow and arrows.

There were ash trees near the lighthouse and, for arrow shafts, a whole copse full of beautifully straight hazel saplings. He began by felling a young ash, cut out six feet of unbranched stem, stripped off the bark and, paring by paring, shaved away the white wood, as old Mitsima had taught him, until he had a stave of his own height, stiff at the thickened centre, lively and quick at the slender tips. The work gave him an intense pleasure. After those weeks of idleness in London, with nothing to do, whenever he wanted anything, but to press a switch or turn a handle, it was pure delight to be doing something that demanded skill and patience.

He had almost finished whittling the stave into shape, when he realized with a start that he was singing--singing! It was as though, stumbling upon himself from the outside, he had suddenly caught himself out, taken himself flagrantly at fault. Guiltily he blushed. After all, it was not to sing and enjoy himself that he had come here. It was to escape further contamination by the filth of civilized life; it was to be purified and made good; it was actively to make amends. He realized to his dismay that, absorbed in the whittling of his bow, he had forgotten what he had sworn to himself he would constantly remember--poor Linda, and his own murderous unkindness to her, and those loathsome twins, swarming like lice across the mystery of her death, insulting, with their presence, not merely his own grief and repentance, but the very gods themselves. He had sworn to remember, he had sworn unceasingly to make amends. And here was he, sitting happily over his bow-stave, singing, actually singing....

He went indoors, opened the box of mustard, and put some water to boil on the fire.

Half an hour later, three Delta-Minus land-workers from one of the Puttenham Bokanovsky Groups happened to be driving to Elstead and, at the top of the hill, were astonished to see a young man standing outside the abandoned lighthouse stripped to the waist and hitting himself with a whip of knotted cords. His back was horizontally streaked with crimson, and from weal to weal ran thin trickles of blood. The driver of the lorry pulled up at the side of the road and, with his two companions, stared open-mouthed at the extraordinary spectacle. One, two, three--they counted the strokes. After the eighth, the young man interrupted his self-punishment to run to the wood's edge and there be violently sick. When he had finished, he picked up the whip and began hitting himself again. Nine, ten, eleven, twelve...

'Ford!' whispered the driver. And his twins were of the same opinion.

'Fordey!' they said.

Three days later, like turkey buzzards settling on a corpse, the reporters came.

Dried and hardened over a slow fire of green wood, the bow was ready. The Savage was busy on his arrows. Thirty hazel sticks had been whittled and dried, tipped with sharp nails, carefully nocked. He had made a raid one night on the Puttenham poultry farm, and now had feathers enough to equip a whole armoury. It was at work upon the feathering of his shafts that the first of the reporters found him. Noiseless on his pneumatic shoes, the man came up behind him.

'Good-morning, Mr. Savage,' he said. 'I am the representative of The Hourly Radio.'

Startled as though by the bite of a snake, the Savage sprang to his feet, scattering arrows, feathers, glue-pot and brush in all directions.

'I beg your pardon,' said the reporter, with genuine compunction. 'I had no intention...' He touched his hat--the aluminium stove-pipe hat in which he carried his wireless receiver and transmitter. 'Excuse my not taking it off,' he said. 'It's a bit heavy. Well, as I was saying, I am the representative of The Hourly...'

'What do you want?' asked the Savage, scowling. The reporter returned his most ingratiating smile.

'Well, of course, our readers would be profoundly interested...' He put his head on one side, his smile became almost coquettish. 'Just a few words from you, Mr. Savage.' And rapidly, with a series of ritual gestures, he uncoiled two wires connected to the portable battery buckled round his waist; plugged them simultaneously into the sides of his aluminium hat; touched a spring on the crown--and antennæ shot up into the air; touched another spring on the peak of the brim--and, like a jack-in-the-box, out jumped a microphone and hung there, quivering, six inches in front of his nose; pulled down a pair of receivers over his ears; pressed a switch on the left side of the hat--and from within came a faint waspy buzzing; turned a knob on the right--and the buzzing was interrupted by a stethoscopic wheeze and crackle, by hiccoughs and sudden squeaks. 'Hullo,' he said to the microphone, 'hullo, hullo...' A bell suddenly rang inside his hat. 'Is that you, Edzel? Primo Mellon speaking. Yes, I've got hold of him. Mr. Savage will now take the microphone and say a few words. Won't you, Mr. Savage?' He looked up at the Savage with another of those winning smiles of his. 'Just tell our readers why you came here. What made you leave London (hold on, Edzel!) so very suddenly. And, of course, that whip.' (The Savage started. How did they know about the whip?) 'We're all crazy to know about the whip. And then something about Civilization. You know the sort of stuff. "What I think of the Civilized Girl." Just a few words, a very few...'

The Savage obeyed with a disconcerting literalness. Five words he uttered and no more--five words, the same as those he had said to Bernard about the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury. 'Háni! Sons éso tse-ná!' And seizing the reporter by the shoulder, he spun him round (the young man revealed himself invitingly well-covered), aimed and, with all the force and accuracy of a champion foot-and-mouth-baller, delivered a most prodigious kick.

Eight minutes later, a new edition of The Hourly Radio was on sale in the streets of London. 'HOURLY RADIO REPORTER HAS COCCYX KICKED BY MYSTERY SAVAGE,' ran the headlines on the front page. 'SENSATION IN SURREY.'

'Sensation even in London,' thought the reporter when, on his return, he read the words. And a very painful sensation, what was more. He sat down gingerly to his luncheon.

Undeterred by that cautionary bruise on their colleague's coccyx, four other reporters, representing the New York Times, the Frankfurt Four-Dimensional Continuum, The Fordian Science Monitor, and The Delta Mirror, called that afternoon at the lighthouse and met with receptions of progressively increasing violence.

From a safe distance and still rubbing his buttocks, 'Benighted fool!' shouted the man from The Fordian Science Monitor, 'why don't you take soma?'

'Get away!' The Savage shook his fist.

The other retreated a few steps, then turned round again. 'Evil's an unreality if you take a couple of grammes.'

'Kohakwa iyathtokyai!' The tone was menacingly derisive.

'Pain's a delusion.'

'Oh, is it?' said the Savage and, picking up a thick hazel switch, strode forward.

The man from The Fordian Science Monitor made a dash for his helicopter.

After that the Savage was left for a time in peace. A few helicopters came and hovered inquisitively round the tower. He shot an arrow into the importunately nearest of them. It pierced the aluminium floor of the cabin; there was a shrill yell, and the machine went rocketing up into the air with all the acceleration that its super-charger could give it. The others, in future, kept their distance respectfully. Ignoring their tiresome humming (he likened himself in his imagination to one of the suitors of the Maiden of Mátsaki, unmoved and persistent among the winged vermin), the Savage dug at what was to be his garden. After a time the vermin evidently became bored and flew away; for hours at a stretch the sky above his head was empty and, but for the larks, silent.

The weather was breathlessly hot, there was thunder in the air. He had dug all the morning and was resting, stretched out along the floor. And suddenly the thought of Lenina was a real presence, naked and tangible, saying 'Sweet!' and 'Put your arms round me!'--in shoes and socks, perfumed. Impudent strumpet! But oh, oh, her arms round his neck, the lifting of her breasts, her mouth! Eternity was in our lips and eyes. Lenina... No, no, no, no! He sprang to his feet and, half naked as he was, ran out of the house. At the edge of the heath stood a clump of hoary juniper bushes. He flung himself against them, he embraced, not the smooth body of his desires, but an armful of green spikes. Sharp, with a thousand points, they pricked him. He tried to think of poor Linda, breathless and dumb, with her clutching hands and the unutterable terror in her eyes. Poor Linda whom he had sworn to remember. But it was still the presence of Lenina that haunted him. Lenina whom he had promised to forget. Even through the stab and sting of the juniper needles, his wincing flesh was aware of her, unescapably real. 'Sweet, sweet... And if you wanted me too, why didn't you...'

The whip was hanging on a nail by the door, ready to hand against the arrival of reporters. In a frenzy the Savage ran back to the house, seized it, whirled it. The knotted cords bit into his flesh.

'Strumpet! Strumpet!' he shouted at every blow as though it were Lenina (and how frantically, without knowing it, he wished it were!), white, warm, scented, infamous Lenina that he was flogging thus. 'Strumpet!' And then, in a voice of despair, 'Oh, Linda, forgive me. Forgive me, God. I'm bad. I'm wicked. I'm... No, no, you strumpet, you strumpet!'

From his carefully constructed hide in the wood three hundred metres away, Darwin Bonaparte, the Feely Corporation's most expert big-game photographer, had watched the whole proceedings. Patience and skill had been rewarded. He had spent three days sitting inside the bole of an artificial oak tree, three nights crawling on his belly through the heather, hiding microphones in gorse bushes, burying wires in the soft grey sand. Seventy-two hours of profound discomfort. But now the great moment had come--the greatest, Darwin Bonaparte had time to reflect, as he moved among his instruments, the greatest since his taking of the famous all-howling stereoscopic feely of the gorillas' wedding. 'Splendid,' he said to himself, as the Savage started his astonishing performance. 'Splendid!' He kept his telescopic cameras carefully aimed--glued to their moving objective; clapped on a higher power to get a close-up of the frantic and distorted face (admirable!); switched over, for half a minute, to slow motion (an exquisitely comical effect, he promised himself); listened in, meanwhile, to the blows, the groans, the wild and raving words that were being recorded on the sound-track at the edge of his film, tried the effect of a little amplification (yes, that was decidedly better); was delighted to hear, in a momentary lull, the shrill singing of a lark; wished the Savage would turn round so that he could get a good close-up of the blood on his back--and almost instantly (what astonishing luck!) the accommodating fellow did turn round, and he was able to take a perfect close-up.

'Well, that was grand!' he said to himself when it was all over. 'Really grand!' He mopped his face. When they had put in the feely effects at the studio, it would be a wonderful film. Almost as good, thought Darwin Bonaparte, as the Sperm Whale's Love-Life--and that, by Ford, was saying a good deal!

Twelve days later The Savage of Surrey had been released and could be seen, heard and felt in every first-class feely-palace in Western Europe.

The effect of Darwin Bonaparte's film was immediate and enormous. On the afternoon which followed the evening of its release, John's rustic solitude was suddenly broken by the arrival overhead of a great swarm of helicopters.

He was digging in his garden--digging, too, in his own mind, laboriously turning up the substance of his thought. Death--and he drove in his spade once, and again, and yet again. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. A convincing thunder rumbled through the words. He lifted another spadeful of earth. Why had Linda died? Why had she been allowed to become gradually less than human and at last... He shuddered. A good kissing carrion. He planted his foot on his spade and stamped it fiercely into the tough ground. As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport. Thunder again; words that proclaimed themselves true--truer somehow than truth itself. And yet that same Gloucester had called them ever-gentle gods. Besides, thy best of rest is sleep, and that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st thy death which is no more. No more than sleep. Sleep. Perchance to dream. His spade struck against a stone; he stooped to pick it up. For in that sleep of death, what dreams?...

A humming overhead had become a roar; and suddenly he was in shadow, there was something between the sun and him. He looked up, startled, from his digging, from his thoughts; looked up in a dazzled bewilderment, his mind still wandering in that other world of truer-than-truth, still focussed on the immensities of death and deity; looked up and saw, close above him, the swarm of hovering machines. Like locusts they came, hung poised, descended all around him on the heather. And from out of the bellies of these giant grasshoppers stepped men in white viscose-flannels, women (for the weather was hot) in acetate-shantung pyjamas or velveteen shorts and sleeveless, half-unzippered singlets--one couple from each. In a few minutes there were dozens of them, standing in a wide circle round the lighthouse, staring, laughing, clicking their cameras, throwing (as to an ape) pea-nuts, packets of sex-hormone chewing-gum, pan-glandular petits beurres. And every moment--for across the Hog's Back the stream of traffic now flowed unceasingly--their numbers increased. As in a nightmare, the dozens became scores, the scores hundreds.

The Savage had retreated towards cover, and now, in the posture of an animal at bay, stood with his back to the wall of the lighthouse, staring from face to face in speechless horror, like a man out of his senses.

From this stupor he was aroused to a more immediate sense of reality by the impact on his cheek of a well-aimed packet of chewing-gum. A shock of startling pain--and he was broad awake, awake and fiercely angry.

'Go away!' he shouted.

The ape had spoken; there was a burst of laughter and hand-clapping. 'Good old Savage! Hurrah, hurrah!' And through the babel he heard cries of: 'Whip, whip, the whip!'

Acting on the word's suggestion, he seized the bunch of knotted cords from its nail behind the door and shook it at his tormentors.

There was a yell of ironical applause.

Menacingly he advanced towards them. A woman cried out in fear. The line wavered at its most immediately threatened point, then stiffened again, stood firm. The consciousness of being in overwhelming force had given these sightseers a courage which the Savage had not expected of them. Taken aback, he halted and looked round.

'Why don't you leave me alone?' There was an almost plaintive note in his anger.

'Have a few magnesium-salted almonds!' said the man who, if the Savage were to advance, would be the first to be attacked. He held out a packet. 'They're really very good, you know,' he added, with a rather nervous smile of propitiation. 'And the magnesium salts will help to keep you young.'

The Savage ignored his offer. 'What do you want with me?' he asked, turning from one grinning face to another. 'What do you want with me?'

'The whip,' answered a hundred voices confusedly. 'Do the whipping stunt. Let's see the whipping stunt.'

Then, in unison and on a slow, heavy rhythm, 'We--want--the whip,' shouted a group at the end of the line. 'We--want--the whip.'

Others at once took up the cry, and the phrase was repeated, parrot-fashion, again and again, with an ever-growing volume of sound, until, by the seventh or eighth reiteration, no other word was being spoken. 'We--want--the whip.'

They were all crying together; and, intoxicated by the noise, the unanimity, the sense of rhythmical atonement, they might, it seemed, have gone on for hours--almost indefinitely. But at about the twenty-fifth repetition the proceedings were startlingly interrupted. Yet another helicopter had arrived from across the Hog's Back, hung poised above the crowd, then dropped within a few yards of where the Savage was standing, in the open space between the line of sightseers and the lighthouse. The roar of the air screws momentarily drowned the shouting; then, as the machine touched the ground and the engines were turned off: 'We--want--the whip; we--want--the whip,' broke out again in the same loud, insistent monotone.

The door of the helicopter opened, and out stepped, first a fair and ruddy-faced young man, then, in green velveteen shorts, white shirt, and jockey cap, a young woman.

At the sight of the young woman, the Savage started, recoiled, turned pale.

The young woman stood, smiling at him--an uncertain, imploring, almost abject smile. The seconds passed. Her lips moved, she was saying something; but the sound of her voice was covered by the loud reiterated refrain of the sightseers.

'We--want--the whip! We--want--the whip!'

The young woman pressed both hands to her left side, and on that peach-bright, doll-beautiful face of hers appeared a strangely incongruous expression of yearning distress. Her blue eyes seemed to grow larger, brighter; and suddenly two tears rolled down her cheeks. Inaudibly, she spoke again; then, with a quick, impassioned gesture stretched out her arms towards the Savage, stepped forward.

'We--want--the whip! We--want...'

And all of a sudden they had what they wanted.

'Strumpet!' The Savage had rushed at her like a madman. 'Fitchew!' Like a madman, he was slashing at her with his whip of small cords.

Terrified, she had turned to flee, had tripped and fallen in the heather. 'Henry, Henry!' she shouted. But her ruddy-faced companion had bolted out of harm's way behind the helicopter.

With a whoop of delighted excitement the line broke; there was a convergent stampede towards that magnetic centre of attraction. Pain was a fascinating horror.

'Fry, lechery, fry!' Frenzied, the Savage slashed again.

Hungrily they gathered round, pushing and scrambling like swine about the trough.

'Oh, the flesh!' The Savage ground his teeth. This time it was on his shoulders that the whip descended. 'Kill it, kill it!'

Drawn by the fascination of the horror of pain and, from within, impelled by that habit of cooperation, that desire for unanimity and atonement, which their conditioning had so ineradicably implanted in them, they began to mime the frenzy of his gestures, striking at one another as the Savage struck at his own rebellious flesh, or at that plump incarnation of turpitude writhing in the heather at his feet.

'Kill it, kill it, kill it...' the Savage went on shouting.

Then suddenly somebody started singing 'Orgy-porgy,' and in a moment they had all caught up the refrain and, singing, had begun to dance. Orgy-porgy, round and round and round, beating one another in six-eight time. Orgy-porgy...

It was after midnight when the last of the helicopters took its flight. Stupefied by soma, and exhausted by a long-drawn frenzy of sensuality, the Savage lay sleeping in the heather. The sun was already high when he awoke. He lay for a moment, blinking in owlish incomprehension at the light; then suddenly remembered--everything.

'Oh, my God, my God!' He covered his eyes with his hand.

****
That evening the swarm of helicopters that came buzzing across the Hog's Back was a dark cloud ten kilometres long. The description of last night's orgy of atonement had been in all the papers.

'Savage!' called the first arrivals, as they alighted from their machine. 'Mr. Savage!'

There was no answer.

The door of the lighthouse was ajar. They pushed it open and walked into a shuttered twilight. Through an archway on the further side of the room they could see the bottom of the staircase that led up to the higher floors. Just under the crown of the arch dangled a pair of feet.

'Mr. Savage!'

Slowly, very slowly, like two unhurried compass needles, the feet turned towards the right; north, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-south-west; then paused, and, after a few seconds, turned as unhurriedly back towards the left. South-southwest, south, south-east, east...

Beloved
 I will call them my people,
 which were not my people;
 And her beloved,
 which was not beloved.
ROMANS 9:25
ONE
124 WAS SPITEFUL. Full of a baby’s venom. The women in the house knew it and so did the children.
For years each put up with the spite in his own way, but by 1873 Sethe and her daughter Denver were its
only victims. The grandmother, Baby Suggs, was dead, and the sons, Howard and Buglar, had run away
by the time they were thirteen years old—as soon as merely looking in a mirror shattered it (that was the
signal for Buglar); as soon as two tiny hand prints appeared in the cake (that was it for Howard). Neither
boy waited to see more; another kettleful of chickpeas smoking in a heap on the floor; soda crackers
crumbled and strewn in a line next to the doorsill. Nor did they wait for one of the relief periods: the
weeks, months even, when nothing was disturbed. No. Each one fled at once—the moment the house
committed what was for him the one insult not to be borne or witnessed a second time. Within two
months, in the dead of winter, leaving their grandmother, Baby Suggs; Sethe, their mother; and their little
sister, Denver, all by themselves in the gray and white house on Bluestone Road. It didn’t have a number
then, because Cincinnati didn’t stretch that far. In fact, Ohio had been calling itself a state only seventy
years when first one brother and then the next stuffed quilt packing into his hat, snatched up his shoes, and
crept away from the lively spite the house felt for them.
Baby Suggs didn’t even raise her head. From her sickbed she heard them go but that wasn’t the reason
she lay still. It was a wonder to her that her grandsons had taken so long to realize that every house wasn’t
like the one on Bluestone Road. Suspended between the nastiness of life and the meanness of the dead,
she couldn’t get interested in leaving life or living it, let alone the fright of two creeping-off boys. Her past
had been like her present—intolerable—and since she knew death was anything but forgetfulness, she
used the little energy left her for pondering color.
“Bring a little lavender in, if you got any. Pink, if you don’t.”
And Sethe would oblige her with anything from fabric to her own tongue. Winter in Ohio was
especially rough if you had an appetite for color. Sky provided the only drama, and counting on a
Cincinnati horizon for life’s principal joy was reckless indeed. So Sethe and the girl Denver did what they
could, and what the house permitted, for her. Together they waged a perfunctory battle against the
outrageous behavior of that place; against turned-over slop jars, smacks on the behind, and gusts of sour
air. For they understood the source of the outrage as well as they knew the source of light.
Baby Suggs died shortly after the brothers left, with no interest whatsoever in their leave-taking or
hers, and right afterward Sethe and Denver decided to end the persecution by calling forth the ghost that
tried them so. Perhaps a conversation, they thought, an exchange of views or something would help. So
they held hands and said, “Come on. Come on. You may as well just come on.”
The sideboard took a step forward but nothing else did.
“Grandma Baby must be stopping it,” said Denver. She was ten and still mad at Baby Suggs for dying.
Sethe opened her eyes. “I doubt that,” she said.
“Then why don’t it come?”
“You forgetting how little it is,” said her mother. “She wasn’t even two years old when she died. Too
little to understand. Too little to talk much even.”
“Maybe she don’t want to understand,” said Denver.
“Maybe. But if she’d only come, I could make it clear to her.” Sethe released her daughter’s hand and
together they pushed the sideboard back against the wall. Outside a driver whipped his horse into the
gallop local people felt necessary when they passed 124.
“For a baby she throws a powerful spell,” said Denver.
“No more powerful than the way I loved her,” Sethe answered and there it was again. The welcoming
cool of unchiseled headstones; the one she selected to lean against on tiptoe, her knees wide open as any
grave. Pink as a fingernail it was, and sprinkled with glittering chips. Ten minutes, he said. You got ten
minutes I’ll do it for free.
Ten minutes for seven letters. With another ten could she have gotten “Dearly” too? She had not
thought to ask him and it bothered her still that it might have been possible—that for twenty minutes, a
half hour, say, she could have had the whole thing, every word she heard the preacher say at the funeral
(and all there was to say, surely) engraved on her baby’s headstone: Dearly Beloved. But what she got,
settled for, was the one word that mattered. She thought it would be enough, rutting among the headstones
with the engraver, his young son looking on, the anger in his face so old; the appetite in it quite new. That
should certainly be enough. Enough to answer one more preacher, one more abolitionist and a town full of
disgust.
Counting on the stillness of her own soul, she had forgotten the other one: the soul of her baby girl.
Who would have thought that a little old baby could harbor so much rage? Rutting among the stones under
the eyes of the engraver’s son was not enough. Not only did she have to live out her years in a house
palsied by the baby’s fury at having its throat cut, but those ten minutes she spent pressed up against
dawn-colored stone studded with star chips, her knees wide open as the grave, were longer than life, more
alive, more pulsating than the baby blood that soaked her fingers like oil.
“We could move,” she suggested once to her mother-in-law.
“What’d be the point?” asked Baby Suggs. “Not a house in the country ain’t packed to its rafters with
some dead Negro’s grief. We lucky this ghost is a baby. My husband’s spirit was to come back in here? or
yours? Don’t talk to me. You lucky. You got three left. Three pulling at your skirts and just one raising
hell from the other side. Be thankful, why don’t you? I had eight. Every one of them gone away from me.
Four taken, four chased, and all, I expect, worrying somebody’s house into evil.” Baby Suggs rubbed her
eyebrows. “My first-born. All I can remember of her is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Can
you beat that? Eight children and that’s all I remember.”
“That’s all you let yourself remember,” Sethe had told her, but she was down to one herself—one
alive, that is—the boys chased off by the dead one, and her memory of Buglar was fading fast. Howard at
least had a head shape nobody could forget. As for the rest, she worked hard to remember as close to
nothing as was safe. Unfortunately her brain was devious. She might be hurrying across a field, running
practically, to get to the pump quickly and rinse the chamomile sap from her legs. Nothing else would be
in her mind. The picture of the men coming to nurse her was as lifeless as the nerves in her back where the
skin buckled like a washboard. Nor was there the faintest scent of ink or the cherry gum and oak bark
from which it was made. Nothing. Just the breeze cooling her face as she rushed toward water. And then
sopping the chamomile away with pump water and rags, her mind fixed on getting every last bit of sap
off—on her carelessness in taking a shortcut across the field just to save a half mile, and not noticing how
high the weeds had grown until the itching was all the way to her knees. Then something. The plash of
water, the sight of her shoes and stockings awry on the path where she had flung them; or Here Boy
lapping in the puddle near her feet, and suddenly there was Sweet Home rolling, rolling, rolling out before
her eyes, and although there was not a leaf on that farm that did not make her want to scream, it rolled
itself out before her in shameless beauty. It never looked as terrible as it was and it made her wonder if
hell was a pretty place too. Fire and brimstone all right, but hidden in lacy groves. Boys hanging from the
most beautiful sycamores in the world. It shamed her—remembering the wonderful soughing trees rather
than the boys. Try as she might to make it otherwise, the sycamores beat out the children every time and
she could not forgive her memory for that.
When the last of the chamomile was gone, she went around to the front of the house, collecting her
shoes and stockings on the way. As if to punish her further for her terrible memory, sitting on the porch
not forty feet away was Paul D, the last of the Sweet Home men. And although she could never mistake
his face for another’s, she said, “Is that you?”
“What’s left.” He stood up and smiled. “How you been, girl, besides barefoot?”
When she laughed it came out loose and young. “Messed up my legs back yonder. Chamomile.”
He made a face as though tasting a teaspoon of something bitter. “I don’t want to even hear ’bout it.
Always did hate that stuff.”
Sethe balled up her stockings and jammed them into her pocket. “Come on in.”
“Porch is fine, Sethe. Cool out here.” He sat back down and looked at the meadow on the other side of
the road, knowing the eagerness he felt would be in his eyes.
“Eighteen years,” she said softly.
“Eighteen,” he repeated. “And I swear I been walking every one of em. Mind if I join you?” He
nodded toward her feet and began unlacing his shoes.
“You want to soak them? Let me get you a basin of water.” She moved closer to him to enter the
house.
“No, uh uh. Can’t baby feet. A whole lot more tramping they got to do yet.”
“You can’t leave right away, Paul D. You got to stay awhile.”
“Well, long enough to see Baby Suggs, anyway. Where is she?”
“Dead.”
“Aw no. When?”
“Eight years now. Almost nine.”
“Was it hard? I hope she didn’t die hard.”
Sethe shook her head. “Soft as cream. Being alive was the hard part. Sorry you missed her though. Is
that what you came by for?”
“That’s some of what I came for. The rest is you. But if all the truth be known, I go anywhere these
days. Anywhere they let me sit down.”
“You looking good.”
“Devil’s confusion. He lets me look good long as I feel bad.” He looked at her and the word “bad”
took on another meaning.
Sethe smiled. This is the way they were—had been. All of the Sweet Home men, before and after
Halle, treated her to a mild brotherly flirtation, so subtle you had to scratch for it.
Except for a heap more hair and some waiting in his eyes, he looked the way he had in Kentucky.
Peachstone skin; straight-backed. For a man with an immobile face it was amazing how ready it was to
smile, or blaze or be sorry with you. As though all you had to do was get his attention and right away be
produced the feeling you were feeling. With less than a blink, his face seemed to change—underneath it
lay the activity.
“I wouldn’t have to ask about him, would I? You’d tell me if there was anything to tell, wouldn’t
you?” Sethe looked down at her feet and saw again the sycamores.
“I’d tell you. Sure I’d tell you. I don’t know any more now than I did then.” Except for the churn, he
thought, and you don’t need to know that. “You must think he’s still alive.”
“No. I think he’s dead. It’s not being sure that keeps him alive.”
“What did Baby Suggs think?”
“Same, but to listen to her, all her children is dead. Claimed she felt each one go the very day and
hour.”
“When she say Halle went?”
“Eighteen fifty-five. The day my baby was born.”
“You had that baby, did you? Never thought you’d make it.” He chuckled. “Running off pregnant.”
“Had to. Couldn’t be no waiting.” She lowered her head and thought, as he did, how unlikely it was
that she had made it. And if it hadn’t been for that girl looking for velvet, she never would have.
“All by yourself too.” He was proud of her and annoyed by her. Proud she had done it; annoyed that
she had not needed Halle or him in the doing.
“Almost by my self. Not all by myself. A whitegirl helped me.”
“Then she helped herself too, God bless her.”
“You could stay the night, Paul D.”
“You don’t sound too steady in the offer.”
Sethe glanced beyond his shoulder toward the closed door. “Oh it’s truly meant. I just hope you’ll
pardon my house. Come on in. Talk to Denver while I cook you something.”
Paul D tied his shoes together, hung them over his shoulder and followed her through the door straight
into a pool of red and undulating light that locked him where he stood.
“You got company?” he whispered, frowning.
“Off and on,” said Sethe.
“Good God.” He backed out the door onto the porch. “What kind of evil you got in here?”
“It’s not evil, just sad. Come on. Just step through.”
He looked at her then, closely. Closer than he had when she first rounded the house on wet and shining
legs, holding her shoes and stockings up in one hand, her skirts in the other. Halle’s girl—the one with
iron eyes and backbone to match. He had never seen her hair in Kentucky. And though her face was
eighteen years older than when last he saw her, it was softer now. Because of the hair. A face too still for
comfort; irises the same color as her skin, which, in that still face, used to make him think of a mask with
mercifully punched-out eyes. Halle’s woman. Pregnant every year including the year she sat by the fire
telling him she was going to run. Her three children she had already packed into a wagonload of others in
a caravan of Negroes crossing the river. They were to be left with Halle’s mother near Cincinnati. Even in
that tiny shack, leaning so close to the fire you could smell the heat in her dress, her eyes did not pick up a
flicker of light. They were like two wells into which he had trouble gazing. Even punched out they needed
to be covered, lidded, marked with some sign to warn folks of what that emptiness held. So he looked
instead at the fire while she told him, because her husband was not there for the telling. Mr. Garner was
dead and his wife had a lump in her neck the size of a sweet potato and unable to speak to anyone. She
leaned as close to the fire as her pregnant belly allowed and told him, Paul D, the last of the Sweet Home
men.
There had been six of them who belonged to the farm, Sethe the only female. Mrs. Garner, crying like
a baby, had sold his brother to pay off the debts that surfaced the minute she was widowed. Then
schoolteacher arrived to put things in order. But what he did broke three more Sweet Home men and
punched the glittering iron out of Sethe’s eyes, leaving two open wells that did not reflect firelight.
Now the iron was back but the face, softened by hair, made him trust her enough to step inside her
door smack into a pool of pulsing red light.
She was right. It was sad. Walking through it, a wave of grief soaked him so thoroughly he wanted to
cry. It seemed a long way to the normal light surrounding the table, but he made it—dry-eyed and lucky.
“You said she died soft. Soft as cream,” he reminded her.
“That’s not Baby Suggs,” she said.
“Who then?”
“My daughter. The one I sent ahead with the boys.”
“She didn’t live?”
“No. The one I was carrying when I run away is all I got left. Boys gone too. Both of em walked off
just before Baby Suggs died.”
Paul D looked at the spot where the grief had soaked him. The red was gone but a kind of weeping
clung to the air where it had been.
Probably best, he thought. If a Negro got legs he ought to use them. Sit down too long, somebody will
figure out a way to tie them up. Still…if her boys were gone…
“No man? You here by yourself?”
“Me and Denver,” she said.
“That all right by you?”
“That’s all right by me.”
She saw his skepticism and went on. “I cook at a restaurant in town. And I sew a little on the sly.”
Paul D smiled then, remembering the bedding dress. Sethe was thirteen when she came to Sweet
Home and already iron-eyed. She was a timely present for Mrs. Garner who had lost Baby Suggs to her
husband’s high principles. The five Sweet Home men looked at the new girl and decided to let her be.
They were young and so sick with the absence of women they had taken to calves. Yet they let the ironeyed girl be, so she could choose in spite of the fact that each one would have beaten the others to mush to
have her. It took her a year to choose—a long, tough year of thrashing on pallets eaten up with dreams of
her. A year of yearning, when rape seemed the solitary gift of life. The restraint they had exercised
possible only because they were Sweet Home men—the ones Mr. Garner bragged about while other
farmers shook their heads in warning at the phrase.
“Y’all got boys,” he told them. “Young boys, old boys, picky boys, stroppin boys. Now at Sweet
Home, my niggers is men every one of em. Bought em thataway, raised em thataway. Men every one.”
“Beg to differ, Garner. Ain’t no nigger men.”
“Not if you scared, they ain’t.” Garner’s smile was wide. “But if you a man yourself, you’ll want your
niggers to be men too.”
“I wouldn’t have no nigger men round my wife.”
It was the reaction Garner loved and waited for. “Neither would I,” he said. “Neither would I,” and
there was always a pause before the neighbor, or stranger, or peddler, or brother-in-law or whoever it was
got the meaning. Then a fierce argument, sometimes a fight, and Garner came home bruised and pleased,
having demonstrated one more time what a real Kentuckian was: one tough enough and smart enough to
make and call his own niggers men.
And so they were: Paul D Garner, Paul F Garner, Paul A Garner, Halle Suggs and Sixo, the wild man.
All in their twenties, minus women, fucking cows, dreaming of rape, thrashing on pallets, rubbing their
thighs and waiting for the new girl—the one who took Baby Suggs’ place after Halle bought her with five
years of Sundays. Maybe that was why she chose him. A twenty-year-old man so in love with his mother
he gave up five years of Sabbaths just to see her sit down for a change was a serious recommendation.
She waited a year. And the Sweet Home men abused cows while they waited with her. She chose
Halle and for their first bedding she sewed herself a dress on the sly.
“Won’t you stay on awhile? Can’t nobody catch up on eighteen years in a day.”
Out of the dimness of the room in which they sat, a white staircase climbed toward the blue-and-white
wallpaper of the second floor. Paul D could see just the beginning of the paper; discreet flecks of yellow
sprinkled among a blizzard of snowdrops all backed by blue. The luminous white of the railing and steps
kept him glancing toward it. Every sense he had told him the air above the stairwell was charmed and very
thin. But the girl who walked down out of that air was round and brown with the face of an alert doll.
Paul D looked at the girl and then at Sethe who smiled saying, “Here she is my Denver. This is Paul
D, honey, from Sweet Home.”
“Good morning, Mr. D.”
“Garner, baby. Paul D Garner.”
“Yes sir ”
“Glad to get a look at you. Last time I saw your mama, you were pushing out the front of her dress.”
“Still is,” Sethe smiled, “provided she can get in it.”
Denver stood on the bottom step and was suddenly hot and shy. It had been a long time since anybody
(good-willed whitewoman, preacher, speaker or newspaperman) sat at their table, their sympathetic voices
called liar by the revulsion in their eyes. For twelve years, long before Grandma Baby died, there had been
no visitors of any sort and. certainly no friends. No coloredpeople. Certainly no hazelnut man with too
long hair and no notebook, no charcoal, no oranges, no questions. Someone her mother wanted to talk to
and would even consider talking to while barefoot. Looking, in fact acting, like a girl instead of the quiet,
queenly woman Denver had known all her life. The one who never looked away, who when a man got
stomped to death by a mare right in front of Sawyer’s restaurant did not look away; and when a sow began
eating her own litter did not look away then either. And when the baby’s spirit picked up Here Boy and
slammed him into the wall hard enough to break two of his legs and dislocate his eye, so hard he went into
convulsions and chewed up his tongue, still her mother had not looked away. She had taken a hammer,
knocked the dog unconscious, wiped away the blood and saliva, pushed his eye back in his head and set
his leg bones. He recovered, mute and off-balance, more because of his untrustworthy eye than his bent
legs, and winter, summer, drizzle or dry, nothing could persuade him to enter the house again.
Now here was this woman with the presence of mind to repair a dog gone savage with pain rocking
her crossed ankles and looking away from her own daughter’s body. As though the size of it was more
than vision could bear. And neither she nor he had on shoes. Hot, shy, now Denver was lonely. All that
leaving: first her brothers, then her grandmother—serious losses since there were no children willing to
circle her in a game or hang by their knees from her porch railing. None of that had mattered as long as
her mother did not look away as she was doing now, making Denver long, downright long, for a sign of
spite from the baby ghost.
“She’s a fine-looking young lady,” said Paul D. “Fine-looking. Got her daddy’s sweet face.”
“You know my father?”
“Knew him. Knew him well.”
“Did he, Ma’am?” Denver fought an urge to realign her affection.
“Of course he knew your daddy. I told you, he’s from Sweet Home.”
Denver sat down on the bottom step. There was nowhere else gracefully to go. They were a twosome,
saying “Your daddy” and “Sweet Home” in a way that made it clear both belonged to them and not to her.
That her own father’s absence was not hers. Once the absence had belonged to Grandma Baby—a son,
deeply mourned because he was the one who had bought her out of there. Then it was her mother’s absent
husband. Now it was this hazelnut stranger’s absent friend. Only those who knew him (“knew him well”)
could claim his absence for themselves. Just as only those who lived in Sweet Home could remember it,
whisper it and glance sideways at one another while they did. Again she wished for the baby ghost—its
anger thrilling her now where it used to wear her out. Wear her out.
“We have a ghost in here,” she said, and it worked. They were not a twosome anymore. Her mother
left off swinging her feet and being girlish. Memory of Sweet Home dropped away from the eyes of the
man she was being girlish for. He looked quickly up the lightning-white stairs behind her.
“So I hear,” he said. “But sad, your mama said. Not evil.”
“No sir,” said Denver, “not evil. But not sad either.”
“What then?”
“Rebuked. Lonely and rebuked.”
“Is that right?” Paul D turned to Sethe.
“I don’t know about lonely,” said Denver’s mother. “Mad, maybe, but I don’t see how it could be
lonely spending every minute with us like it does.”
“Must be something you got it wants.”
Sethe shrugged. “It’s just a baby.”
“My sister,” said Denver. “She died in this house.”
Paul D scratched the hair under his jaw. “Reminds me of that headless bride back behind Sweet Home.
Remember that, Sethe? Used to roam them woods regular.”
“How could I forget? Worrisome…”
“How come everybody run off from Sweet Home can’t stop talking about it? Look like if it was so
sweet you would have stayed.”
“Girl, who you talking to?”
Paul D laughed. “True, true. She’s right, Sethe. It wasn’t sweet and it sure wasn’t home.” He shook his
head.
“But it’s where we were,” said Sethe. “All together. Comes back whether we want it to or not.” She
shivered a little. A light ripple of skin on her arm, which she caressed back into sleep. “Denver,” she said,
“start up that stove. Can’t have a friend stop by and don’t feed him.”
“Don’t go to any trouble on my account,” Paul D said.
“Bread ain’t trouble. The rest I brought back from where I work. Least I can do, cooking from dawn to
noon, is bring dinner home. You got any objections to pike?”
“If he don’t object to me I don’t object to him.”
At it again, thought Denver. Her back to them, she jostled the kindlin and almost lost the fire. “Why
don’t you spend the night, Mr. Garner? You and Ma’am can talk about Sweet Home all night long.”
Sethe took two swift steps to the stove, but before she could yank Denver’s collar, the girl leaned
forward and began to cry.
“What is the matter with you? I never knew you to behave this way.”
“Leave her be,” said Paul D. “I’m a stranger to her.”
“That’s just it. She got no cause to act up with a stranger. Ob baby, what is it? Did something
happen?”
But Denver was shaking now and sobbing so she could not speak. The tears she had not shed for nine
years wetting her far too womanly breasts.
“I can’t no more. I can’t no more.”
“Can’t what? What can’t you?” “I can’t live here. I don’t know where to go or what to do, but I can’t
live here. Nobody speaks to us. Nobody comes by. Boys don’t like me. Girls don’t either.”
“Honey, honey.”
“What’s she talking ‘bout nobody speaks to you?” asked Paul D.
“It’s the house. People don’t—”
“It’s not! It’s not the house. It’s us! And it’s you!”
“Denver!”
“Leave off, Sethe. It’s hard for a young girl living in a haunted house. That can’t be easy.”
“It’s easier than some other things.”
“Think, Sethe. I’m a grown man with nothing new left to see or do and I’m telling you it ain’t easy.
Maybe you all ought to move. Who owns this house?”
Over Denver’s shoulder Sethe shot Paul D a look of snow. “What you care?”
“They won’t let you leave?”
“No.”
“Sethe.”
“No moving. No leaving. It’s all right the way it is.”
“You going to tell me it’s all right with this child half out of her mind?”
Something in the house braced, and in the listening quiet that followed Sethe spoke.
“I got a tree on my back and a haint in my house, and nothing in between but the daughter I am
holding in my arms. No more running—from nothing. I will never run from another thing on this earth. I
took one journey and I paid for the ticket, but let me tell you something, Paul D Garner: it cost too much!
Do you hear me? It cost too much. Now sit down and eat with us or leave us be.”
Paul D fished in his vest for a little pouch of tobacco—concentrating on its contents and the knot of its
string while Sethe led Denver into the keeping room that opened off the large room he was sitting in. He
had no smoking papers, so he fiddled with the pouch and listened through the open door to Sethe quieting
her daughter. When she came back she avoided his look and went straight to a small table next to the
stove. Her back was to him and he could see all the hair he wanted without the distraction of her face.
“What tree on your back?”
“Huh.” Sethe put a bowl on the table and reached under it for flour.
“What tree on your back? Is something growing on your back? I don’t see nothing growing on your
back.”
“It’s there all the same.”
“Who told you that?”
“Whitegirl. That’s what she called it. I’ve never seen it and never will. But that’s what she said it
looked like. A chokecherry tree. Trunk, branches, and even leaves. Tiny little chokecherry leaves. But that
was eighteen years ago. Could have cherries too now for all I know.”
Sethe took a little spit from the tip of her tongue with her forefinger. Quickly, lightly she touched the
stove. Then she trailed her fingers through the flour, parting, separating small hills and ridges of it,
looking for mites. Finding none, she poured soda and salt into the crease of her folded hand and tossed
both into the flour. Then she reached into a can and scooped half a handful of lard. Deftly she squeezed
the flour through it, then with her left hand sprinkling water, she formed the dough.
“I had milk,” she said. “I was pregnant with Denver but I had milk for my baby girl. I hadn’t stopped
nursing her when I sent her on ahead with Howard and Buglar.”
Now she rolled the dough out with a wooden pin. “Anybody could smell me long before he saw me.
And when he saw me he’d see the drops of it on the front of my dress. Nothing I could do about that. All I
knew was I had to get my milk to my baby girl. Nobody was going to nurse her like me. Nobody was
going to get it to her fast enough, or take it away when she had enough and didn’t know it. Nobody knew
that she couldn’t pass her air if you held her up on your shoulder, only if she was lying on my knees.
Nobody knew that but me and nobody had her milk but me. I told that to the women in the wagon. Told
them to put sugar water in cloth to suck from so when I got there in a few days she wouldn’t have forgot
me. The milk would be there and I would be there with it.”
“Men don’t know nothing much,” said Paul D, tucking his pouch back into his vest pocket, “but they
do know a suckling can’t be away from its mother for long.”
“Then they know what it’s like to send your children off when your breasts are full.”
“We was talking ’bout a tree, Sethe”
“After I left you, those boys came in there and took my milk. That’s what they came in there for. Held
me down and took it. I told Mrs. Garner on em. She had that lump and couldn’t speak but her eyes rolled
out tears. Them boys found out I told on em. Schoolteacher made one open up my back, and when it
closed it made a tree. It grows there still.”
“They used cowhide on you?”
“And they took my milk.”
“They beat you and you was pregnant?”
“And they took my milk!”
The fat white circles of dough lined the pan in rows. Once more Sethe touched a wet forefinger to the
stove. She opened the oven door and slid the pan of biscuits in. As she raised up from the heat she felt
Paul D behind her and his hands under her breasts. She straightened up and knew, but could not feel, that
his cheek was pressing into the branches of her chokecherry tree.
Not even trying, he had become the kind of man who could walk into a house and make the women
cry. Because with him, in his presence, they could. There was something blessed in his manner. Women
saw him and wanted to weep—to tell him that their chest hurt and their knees did too. Strong women and
wise saw him and told him things they only told each other: that way past the Change of Life, desire in
them had suddenly become enormous, greedy, more savage than when they were fifteen, and that it
embarrassed them and made them sad; that secretly they longed to die—to be quit of it—that sleep was
more precious to them than any waking day. Young girls sidled up to him to confess or describe how welldressed the visitations were that had followed them straight from their dreams. Therefore, although he did
not understand why this was so, he was not surprised when Denver dripped tears into the stovefire. Nor,
fifteen minutes later, after telling him about her stolen milk, her mother wept as well. Behind her, bending
down, his body an arc of kindness, he held her breasts in the palms of his hands. He rubbed his cheek on
her back and learned that way her sorrow, the roots of it; its wide trunk and intricate branches. Raising his
fingers to the hooks of her dress, he knew without seeing them or hearing any sigh that the tears were
coming fast. And when the top of her dress was around her hips and he saw the sculpture her back had
become, like the decorative work of an ironsmith too passionate for display, he could think but not say,
“Aw, Lord, girl.” And he would tolerate no peace until he had touched every ridge and leaf of it with his
mouth, none of which Sethe could feel because her back skin had been dead for years. What she knew was
that the responsibility for her breasts, at last, was in somebody else’s hands.
Would there be a little space, she wondered, a little time, some way to hold off eventfulness, to push
busyness into the corners of the room and just stand there a minute or two, naked from shoulder blade to
waist, relieved of the weight of her breasts, smelling the stolen milk again and the pleasure of baking
bread? Maybe this one time she could stop dead still in the middle of a cooking meal—not even leave the
stove—and feel the hurt her back ought to. Trust things and remember things because the last of the Sweet
Home men was there to catch her if she sank?
The stove didn’t shudder as it adjusted to its heat. Denver wasn’t stirring in the next room. The pulse
of red light hadn’t come back and Paul D had not trembled since 1856 and then for eighty-three days in a
row. Locked up and chained down, his hands shook so bad he couldn’t smoke or even scratch properly.
Now he was trembling again but in the legs this time. It took him a while to realize that his legs were not
shaking because of worry, but because the floorboards were and the grinding, shoving floor was only part
of it. The house itself was pitching. Sethe slid to the floor and struggled to get back into her dress. While
down on all fours, as though she were holding her house down on the ground, Denver burst from the
keeping room, terror in her eyes, a vague smile on her lips.
“God damn it! Hush up!” Paul D was shouting, falling, reaching for anchor. “Leave the place alone!
Get the hell out!” A table rushed toward him and he grabbed its leg. Somehow he managed to stand at an
angle and, holding the table by two legs, he bashed it about, wrecking everything, screaming back at the
screaming house. “You want to fight, come on! God damn it! She got enough without you. She got
enough!”
The quaking slowed to an occasional lurch, but Paul D did not stop whipping the table around until
everything was rock quiet. Sweating and breathing hard, he leaned against the wall in the space the
sideboard left. Sethe was still crouched next to the stove, clutching her salvaged shoes to her chest. The
three of them, Sethe, Denver, and Paul D, breathed to the same beat, like one tired person. Another
breathing was just as tired.
It was gone. Denver wandered through the silence to the stove. She ashed over the fire and pulled the
pan of biscuits from the oven. The jelly cupboard was on its back, its contents lying in a heap in the corner
of the bottom shelf. She took out a jar, and, looking around for a plate, found half of one by the door.
These things she carried out to the porch steps, where she sat down.
The two of them had gone up there. Stepping lightly, easy-footed, they had climbed the white stairs,
leaving her down below. She pried the wire from the top of the jar and then the lid. Under it was cloth and
under that a thin cake of wax. She removed it all and coaxed the jelly onto one half of the half a plate. She
took a biscuit and pulled off its black top. Smoke curled from the soft white insides.
She missed her brothers. Buglar and Howard would be twenty-two and twenty-three now. Although
they had been polite to her during the quiet time and gave her the whole top of the bed, she remembered
how it was before: the pleasure they had sitting clustered on the white stairs—she between the knees of
Howard or Buglar—while they made up die-witch! stories with proven ways of killing her dead. And
Baby Suggs telling her things in the keeping room. She smelled like bark in the day and leaves at night,
for Denver would not sleep in her old room after her brothers ran away.
Now her mother was upstairs with the man who had gotten rid of the only other company she had.
Denver dipped a bit of bread into the jelly. Slowly, methodically, miserably she ate it.
NOT QUITE in a hurry, but losing no time, Sethe and Paul D climbed the white stairs. Overwhelmed as
much by the downright luck of finding her house and her in it as by the certainty of giving her his sex,
Paul D dropped twenty-five years from his recent memory. A stair step before him was Baby Suggs’
replacement, the new girl they dreamed of at night and fucked cows for at dawn while waiting for her to
choose. Merely kissing the wrought iron on her back had shook the house, had made it necessary for him
to beat it to pieces. Now he would do more.
She led him to the top of the stairs, where light came straight from the sky because the second-story
windows of that house had been placed in the pitched ceiling and not the walls. There were two rooms and
she took him into one of them, hoping he wouldn’t mind the fact that she was not prepared; that though
she could remember desire, she had forgotten how it worked; the clutch and helplessness that resided in
the hands; how blindness was altered so that what leapt to the eye were places to lie down, and all else—
door knobs, straps, hooks, the sadness that crouched in corners, and the passing of time—was interference.
It was over before they could get their clothes off. Half-dressed and short of breath, they lay side by
side resentful of one another and the skylight above them. His dreaming of her had been too long and too
long ago. Her deprivation had been not having any dreams of her own at all. Now they were sorry and too
shy to make talk.
Sethe lay on her back, her lead turned from him. Out of the corner of his eye, Paul D saw the float of
her breasts and disliked it, the spread-away, flat roundness of them that he could definitely live without,
never mind that downstairs he had held them as though they were the most expensive part of himself. And
the wrought-iron maze he had explored in the kitchen like a gold miner pawing through pay dirt was in
fact a revolting clump of scars. Not a tree, as she said. Maybe shaped like one, but nothing like any tree he
knew because trees were inviting; things you could trust and be near; talk to if you wanted to as he
frequently did since way back when he took the midday meal in the fields of Sweet Home. Always in the
same place if he could, and choosing the place had been hard because Sweet Home had more pretty trees
than any farm around. His choice he called Brother, and sat under it, alone sometimes, sometimes with
Halle or the other Pauls, but more often with Sixo, who was gentle then and still speaking English. Indigo
with a flame-red tongue, Sixo experimented with night-cooked potatoes, trying to pin down exactly when
to put smoking-hot rocks in a hole, potatoes on top, and cover the whole thing with twigs so that by the
time they broke for the meal, hitched the animals, left the field and got to Brother, the potatoes would be
at the peak of perfection. He might get up in the middle of the night, go all the way out there, start the
earth-over by starlight; or he would make the stones less hot and put the next day’s potatoes on them right
after the meal. He never got it right, but they ate those undercooked, overcooked, dried-out or raw
potatoes anyway, laughing, spitting and giving him advice.
Time never worked the way Sixo thought, so of course he never got it right. Once he plotted down to
the minute a thirty-mile trip to see a woman. He left on a Saturday when the moon was in the place he
wanted it to be, arrived at her cabin before church on Sunday and had just enough time to say good
morning before he had to start back again so he’d make the field call on time Monday morning. He had
walked for seventeen hours, sat down for one, turned around and walked seventeen more. Halle and the
Pauls spent the whole day covering Sixo’s fatigue from Mr. Garner. They ate no potatoes that day, sweet
or white. Sprawled near Brother, his flame-red tongue hidden from them, his indigo face closed, Sixo slept
through dinner like a corpse. Now there was a man, and that was a tree. Himself lying in the bed and the
“tree” lying next to him didn’t compare.
Paul D looked through the window above his feet and folded his hands behind his head. An elbow
grazed Sethe’s shoulder. The touch of cloth on her skin startled her. She had forgotten he had not taken off
his shirt. Dog, she thought, and then remembered that she had not allowed him the time for taking it off.
Nor herself time to take off her petticoat, and considering she had begun undressing before she saw him
on the porch, that her shoes and stockings were already in her hand and she had never put them back on;
that he had looked at her wet bare feet and asked to join her; that when she rose to cook he had undressed
her further; considering how quickly they had started getting naked, you’d think by now they would be.
But maybe a man was nothing but a man, which is what Baby Suggs always said. They encouraged you to
put some of your weight in their hands and soon as you felt how light and lovely that was, they studied
your scars and tribulations, after which they did what he had done: ran her children out and tore up the
house.
She needed to get up from there, go downstairs and piece it all back together. This house he told her to
leave as though a house was a little thing—a shirtwaist or a sewing basket you could walk off from or give
away any old time. She who had never had one but this one; she who left a dirt floor to come to this one;
she who had to bring a fistful of salsify into Mrs. Garner’s kitchen every day just to be able to work in it,
feel like some part of it was hers, because she wanted to love the work she did, to take the ugly out of it,
and the only way she could feel at home on Sweet Home was if she picked some pretty growing thing and
took it with her. The day she forgot was the day butter wouldn’t come or the brine in the barrel blistered
her arms.
At least it seemed so. A few yellow flowers on the table, some myrtle tied around the handle of the
flatiron holding the door open for a breeze calmed her, and when Mrs. Garner and she sat down to sort
bristle, or make ink, she felt fine. Fine. Not scared of the men beyond. The five who slept in quarters near
her, but never came in the night. Just touched their raggedy hats when they saw her and stared. And if she
brought food to them in the fields, bacon and bread wrapped in a piece of clean sheeting, they never took
it from her hands. They stood back and waited for her to put it on the ground (at the foot of a tree) and
leave. Either they did not want to take anything from her, or did not want her to see them eat. Twice or
three times she lingered. Hidden behind honeysuckle she watched them. How different they were without
her, how they laughed and played and urinated and sang. All but Sixo, who laughed once—at the very
end. Halle, of course, was the nicest. Baby Suggs’ eighth and last child, who rented himself out all over
the county to buy her away from there. But he too, as it turned out, was nothing but a man.
“A man ain’t nothing but a man,” said Baby Suggs. “But a son? Well now, that’s somebody.”
It made sense for a lot of reasons because in all of Baby’s life, as well as Sethe’s own, men and
women were moved around like checkers. Anybody Baby Suggs knew, let alone loved, who hadn’t run off
or been hanged, got rented out, loaned out, bought up, brought back, stored up, mortgaged, won, stolen or
seized. So Baby’s eight children had six fathers. What she called the nastiness of life was the shock she
received upon learning that nobody stopped playing checkers just because the pieces included her
children. Halle she was able to keep the longest. Twenty years. A lifetime. Given to her, no doubt, to make
up for hearing that her two girls, neither of whom had their adult teeth, were sold and gone and she had
not been able to wave goodbye. To make up for coupling with a straw boss for four months in exchange
for keeping her third child, a boy, with her—only to have him traded for lumber in the spring of the next
year and to find herself pregnant by the man who promised not to and did. That child she could not love
and the rest she would not. “God take what He would,” she said. And He did, and He did, and He did and
then gave her Halle who gave her freedom when it didn’t mean a thing.
Sethe had the amazing luck of six whole years of marriage to that “somebody” son who had fathered
every one of her children. A blessing she was reckless enough to take for granted, lean on, as though
Sweet Home really was one. As though a handful of myrtle stuck in the handle of a pressing iron propped
against the door in a whitewoman’s kitchen could make it hers. As though mint sprig in the mouth
changed the breath as well as its odor. A bigger fool never lived.
Sethe started to turn over on her stomach but changed her mind. She did not want to call Paul D’s
attention back to her, so she settled for crossing her ankles.
But Paul D noticed the movement as well as the change in her breathing. He felt obliged to try again,
slower this time, but the appetite was gone. Actually it was a good feeling—not wanting her. Twenty-five
years and blip! The kind of thing Sixo would do—like the time he arranged a meeting with Patsy the
Thirty-Mile Woman. It took three months and two thirty-four-mile round trips to do it. To persuade her to
walk one-third of the way toward him, to a place he knew. A deserted stone structure that Redmen used
way back when they thought the land was theirs. Sixo discovered it on one of his night creeps, and asked
its permission to enter. Inside, having felt what it felt like, he asked the Redmen’s Presence if he could
bring his woman there. It said yes and Sixo painstakingly instructed her how to get there, exactly when to
start out, how his welcoming or warning whistles would sound. Since neither could go anywhere on
business of their own, and since the Thirty-Mile Woman was already fourteen and scheduled for
somebody’s arms, the danger was real. When he arrived, she had not. He whistled and got no answer. He
went into the Redmen’s deserted lodge. She was not there. He returned to the meeting spot. She was not
there. He waited longer. She still did not come. He grew frightened for her and walked down the road in
the direction she should be coming from. Three or four miles, and he stopped. It was hopeless to go on
that way, so he stood in the wind and asked for help. Listening close for some sign, he heard a whimper.
He turned toward it, waited and heard it again. Uncautious now, he hollered her name. She answered in a
voice that sounded like life to him—not death. “Not move!” be shouted. “Breathe hard I can find you.” He
did. She believed she was already at the meeting place and was crying because she thought he had not
kept his promise. Now it was too late for the rendezvous to happen at the Redmen’s house, so they
dropped where they were. Later be punctured her calf to simulate snakebite so she could use it in some
way as an excuse for not being on time to shake worms from tobacco leaves. He gave her detailed
directions about following the stream as a shortcut back, and saw her off. When he got to the road it was
very light and he had his clothes in his hands. Suddenly from around a bend a wagon trundled toward him.
Its driver, wide-eyed, raised a whip while the woman seated beside him covered her face. But Sixo had
already melted into the woods before the lash could unfurl itself on his indigo behind.
He told the story to Paul F, Halle, Paul A and Paul D in the peculiar way that made them cry-laugh.
Sixo went among trees at night. For dancing, he said, to keep his bloodlines open, he said. Privately,
alone, he did it. None of the rest of them had seen him at it, but they could imagine it, and the picture they
pictured made them eager to laugh at him—in daylight, that is, when it was safe.
But that was before he stopped speaking English because there was no future in it. Because of the
Thirty-Mile Woman Sixo was the only one not paralyzed by yearning for Sethe. Nothing could be as good
as the sex with her Paul D had been imagining off and on for twenty-five years. His foolishness made him
smile and think fondly of himself as he turned over on his side, facing her. Sethe’s eyes were closed, her
hair a mess. Looked at this way, minus the polished eyes, her face was not so attractive. So it must have
been her eyes that kept him both guarded and stirred up. Without them her face was manageable—a face
he could handle. Maybe if she would keep them closed like that… But no, there was her mouth. Nice.
Halle never knew what he had.
Although her eyes were closed, Sethe knew his gaze was on her face, and a paper picture of just how
bad she must look raised itself up before her mind’s eye. Still, there was no mockery coming from his
gaze. Soft. It felt soft in a waiting kind of way. He was not judging her—or rather he was judging but not
comparing her. Not since Halle had a man looked at her that way: not loving or passionate, but interested,
as though he were examining an ear of corn for quality. Halle was more like a brother than a husband. His
care suggested a family relationship rather than a man’s laying claim. For years they saw each other in full
daylight only on Sundays. The rest of the time they spoke or touched or ate in darkness. Predawn darkness
and the afterlight of sunset. So looking at each other intently was a Sunday-morning pleasure and Halle
examined her as though storing up what he saw in sunlight for the shadow he saw the rest of the week.
And he had so little time. After his Sweet Home work and on Sunday afternoons was the debt work he
owed for his mother. When he asked her to be his wife, Sethe happily agreed and then was stuck not
knowing the next step. There should be a ceremony, shouldn’t there? A preacher, some dancing, a party, a
something. She and Mrs. Garner were the only women there, so she decided to ask her.
“Halle and me want to be married, Mrs. Garner.”
“So I heard.” She smiled. “He talked to Mr. Garner about it. Are you already expecting?”
“No, ma’am.”
“Well, you will be. You know that, don’t you?”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Halle’s nice, Sethe. He’ll be good to you.”
“But I mean we want to get married.”
“You just said so. And I said all right.”
“Is there a wedding?”
Mrs. Garner put down her cooking spoon. Laughing a little, she touched Sethe on the head, saying,
“You are one sweet child.” And then no more.
Sethe made a dress on the sly and Halle hung his hitching rope from a nail on the wall of her cabin.
And there on top of a mattress on top of the dirt floor of the cabin they coupled for the third time, the first
two having been in the tiny cornfield Mr. Garner kept because it was a crop animals could use as well as
humans. Both Halle and Sethe were under the impression that they were hidden. Scrunched down among
the stalks they couldn’t see anything, including the corn tops waving over their heads and visible to
everyone else.
Sethe smiled at her and Halle’s stupidity. Even the crows knew and came to look. Uncrossing her
ankles, she managed not to laugh aloud.
The jump, thought Paul D, from a calf to a girl wasn’t all that mighty. Not the leap Halle believed it
would be. And taking her in the corn rather than her quarters, a yard away from the cabins of the others
who had lost out, was a gesture of tenderness. Halle wanted privacy for her and got public display. Who
could miss a ripple in a cornfield on a quiet cloudless day? He, Sixo and both of the Pauls sat under
Brother pouring water from a gourd over their heads, and through eyes streaming with well water, they
watched the confusion of tassels in the field below. It had been hard, hard, hard sitting there erect as dogs,
watching corn stalks dance at noon. The water running over their heads made it worse.
Paul D sighed and turned over. Sethe took the opportunity afforded by his movement to shift as well.
Looking at Paul D’s back, she remembered that some of the corn stalks broke, folded down over Halle’s
back, and among the things her fingers clutched were husk and cornsilk hair.
How loose the silk. How jailed down the juice.
The jealous admiration of the watching men melted with the feast of new corn they allowed
themselves that night. Plucked from the broken stalks that Mr. Garner could not doubt was the fault of the
raccoon. Paul F wanted his roasted; Paul A wanted his boiled and now Paul D couldn’t remember how
finally they’d cooked those ears too young to eat. What he did remember was parting the hair to get to the
tip, the edge of his fingernail just under, so as not to graze a single kernel.
The pulling down of the tight sheath, the ripping sound always convinced her it hurt.
As soon as one strip of husk was down, the rest obeyed and the ear yielded up to him its shy rows,
exposed at last. How loose the silk. How quick the jailed-up flavor ran free.
No matter what all your teeth and wet fingers anticipated, there was no accounting for the way that
simple joy could shake you.
How loose the silk. How fine and loose and free.
DENVER’S SECRETS were sweet. Accompanied every time by wild veronica until she discovered
cologne. The first bottle was a gift, the next she stole from her mother and hid among boxwood until it
froze and cracked. That was the year winter came in a hurry at suppertime and stayed eight months. One
of the War years when Miss Bodwin, the whitewoman, brought Christmas cologne for her mother and
herself, oranges for the boys and another good wool shawl for Baby Suggs. Talking of a war full of dead
people, she looked happy—flush-faced, and although her voice was heavy as a man’s, she smelled like a
roomful of flowers—excitement that Denver could have all for herself in the boxwood. Back beyond 124
was a narrow field that stopped itself at a wood. On the yonder side of these woods, a stream. In these
woods, between the field and the stream, hidden by post oaks, five boxwood bushes, planted in a ring, had
started stretching toward each other four feet off the ground to form a round, empty room seven feet high,
its walls fifty inches of murmuring leaves.
Bent low, Denver could crawl into this room, and once there she could stand all the way up in emerald
light.
It began as a little girl’s houseplay, but as her desires changed, so did the play. Quiet, primate and
completely secret except for the noisome cologne signal that thrilled the rabbits before it confused them.
First a playroom (where the silence was softer), then a refuge (from her brothers’ fright), soon the place
became the point. In that bower, closed off from the hurt of the hurt world, Denver’s imagination
produced its own hunger and its own food, which she badly needed because loneliness wore her out. Wore
her out. Veiled and protected by the live green walls, she felt ripe and clear, and salvation was as easy as a
wish.
Once when she was in the boxwood, an autumn long before Paul D moved into the house with her
mother, she was made suddenly cold by a combination of wind and the perfume on her skin. She dressed
herself, bent down to leave and stood up in snowfall: a thin and whipping snow very like the picture her
mother had painted as she described the circumstances of Denver’s birth in a canoe straddled by a
whitegirl for whom she was named.
Shivering, Denver approached the house, regarding it, as she always did, as a person rather than a
structure. A person that wept, sighed, trembled and fell into fits. Her steps and her gaze were the cautious
ones of a child approaching a nervous, idle relative (someone dependent but proud). A breastplate of
darkness hid all the windows except one. Its dim glow came from Baby Suggs’ room. When Denver
looked in, she saw her mother on her knees in prayer, which was not unusual. What was unusual (even for
a girl who had lived all her life in a house peopled by the living activity of the dead) was that a white dress
knelt down next to her mother and had its sleeve around her mother’s waist. And it was the tender
embrace of the dress sleeve that made Denver remember the details of her birth—that and the thin,
whipping snow she was standing in, like the fruit of common flowers. The dress and her mother together
looked like two friendly grown-up women—one (the dress) helping out the other. And the magic of her
birth, its miracle in fact, testified to that friendliness as did her own name.
Easily she stepped into the told story that lay before her eyes on the path she followed away from the
window. There was only one door to the house and to get to it from the back you had to walk all the way
around to the front of 124, past the storeroom, past the cold house, the privy, the shed, on around to the
porch. And to get to the part of the story she liked best, she had to start way back: hear the birds in the
thick woods, the crunch of leaves underfoot; see her mother making her way up into the hills where no
houses were likely to be. How Sethe was walking on two feet meant for standing still. How they were so
swollen she could not see her arch or feel her ankles. Her leg shaft ended in a loaf of flesh scalloped by
five toenails. But she could not, would not, stop, for when she did the little antelope rammed her with
horns and pawed the ground of her womb with impatient hooves. While she was walking, it seemed to
graze, quietly—so she walked, on two feet meant, in this sixth month of pregnancy, for standing still. Still,
near a kettle; still, at the churn; still, at the tub and ironing board. Milk, sticky and sour on her dress,
attracted every small flying thing from gnats to grasshoppers. By the time she reached the hill skirt she
had long ago stopped waving them off. The clanging in her head, begun as a churchbell heard from a
distance, was by then a tight cap of pealing bells around her ears. She sank and had to look down to see
whether she was in a hole or kneeling. Nothing was alive but her nipples and the little antelope. Finally,
she was horizontal—or must have been because blades of wild onion were scratching her temple and her
cheek. Concerned as she was for the life of her children’s mother, Sethe told Denver, she remembered
thinking: “Well, at least I don’t have to take another step.” A dying thought if ever there was one, and she
waited for the little antelope to protest, and why she thought of an antelope Sethe could not imagine since
she had never seen one. She guessed it must have been an invention held on to from before Sweet Home,
when she was very young. Of that place where she was born (Carolina maybe? or was it Louisiana?) she
remembered only song and dance. Not even her own mother, who was pointed out to her by the eightyear-old child who watched over the young ones—pointed out as the one among many backs turned away
from her, stooping in a watery field. Patiently Sethe waited for this particular back to gain the row’s end
and stand. What she saw was a cloth hat as opposed to a straw one, singularity enough in that world of
cooing women each of whom was called Ma’am.
“Seth—thuh.”
“Ma’am.”
“Hold on to the baby.”
“Yes, Ma’am.”
“Seth—thuh.”
“Ma’am.”
“Get some kindlin in here.”
“Yes, Ma’am.”
Oh but when they sang. And oh but when they danced and sometimes they danced the antelope. The
men as well as the ma’ams, one of whom was certainly her own. They shifted shapes and became
something other. Some unchained, demanding other whose feet knew her pulse better than she did. Just
like this one in her stomach.
“I believe this baby’s ma’am is gonna die in wild onions on the bloody side of the Ohio River.” That’s
what was on her mind and what she told Denver. Her exact words. And it didn’t seem such a bad idea, all
in all, in view of the step she would not have to take, but the thought of herself stretched out dead while
the little antelope lived on—an hour? a day? a day and a night?—in her lifeless body grieved her so she
made the groan that made the person walking on a path not ten yards away halt and stand right still. Sethe
had not heard the walking, but suddenly she heard the standing still and then she smelled the hair. The
voice, saying, “Who’s in there?” was all she needed to know that she was about to be discovered by a
whiteboy. That he too had mossy teeth, an appetite. That on a ridge of pine near the Ohio River, trying to
get to her three children, one of whom was starving for the food she carried; that after her husband had
disappeared; that after her milk had been stolen, her back pulped, her children orphaned, she was not to
have an easeful death. No.
She told Denver that a something came up out of the earth into her—like a freezing, but moving too,
like jaws inside. “Look like I was just cold jaws grinding,” she said. Suddenly she was eager for his eyes,
to bite into them; to gnaw his cheek.
“I was hungry,” she told Denver, “just as hungry as I could be for his eyes. I couldn’t wait.”
So she raised up on her elbow and dragged herself, one pull, two, three, four, toward the young white
voice talking about “Who that back in there?”
“ ‘Come see,’ I was thinking. ‘Be the last thing you behold,’ and sure enough here come the feet so I
thought well that’s where I’ll have to start God do what He would, I’m gonna eat his feet off. I’m laughing
now, but it’s true. I wasn’t just set to do it. I was hungry to do it. Like a snake. All jaws and hungry.
“It wasn’t no whiteboy at all. Was a girl. The raggediest-looking trash you ever saw saying, ‘Look
there. A nigger. If that don’t beat all.’ ”
And now the part Denver loved the best:
Her name was Amy and she needed beef and pot liquor like nobody in this world. Arms like cane
stalks and enough hair for four or five heads. Slow-moving eyes. She didn’t look at anything quick.
Talked so much it wasn’t clear how she could breathe at the same time. And those cane-stalk arms, as it
turned out, were as strong as iron.
“You ’bout the scariest-looking something I ever seen. What you doing back up in here?”
Down in the grass, like the snake she believed she was, Sethe opened her mouth, and instead of fangs
and a split tongue, out shot the truth.
“Running,” Sethe told her. It was the first word she had spoken all day and it came out thick because
of her tender tongue.
“Them the feet you running on? My Jesus my.” She squatted down and stared at Sethe’s feet. “You
got anything on you, gal, pass for food?”
“No.” Sethe tried to shift to a sitting position but couldn’t.
“I like to die I’m so hungry.” The girl moved her eyes slowly, examining the greenery around her.
“Thought there’d be huckleberries. Look like it. That’s why I come up in here. Didn’t expect to find no
nigger woman. If they was any, birds ate em. You like huckleberries?”
“I’m having a baby, miss.”
Amy looked at her. “That mean you don’t have no appetite? Well I got to eat me something.”
Combing her hair with her fingers, she carefully surveyed the landscape once more. Satisfied nothing
edible was around, she stood up to go and Sethe’s heart stood up too at the thought of being left alone in
the grass without a fang in her head.
“Where you on your way to, miss?”
She turned and looked at Sethe with freshly lit eyes. “Boston. Get me some velvet. It’s a store there
called Wilson. I seen the pictures of it and they have the prettiest velvet. They don’t believe I’m a get it,
but I am.”
Sethe nodded and shifted her elbow. “Your ma’am know you on the lookout for velvet?”
The girl shook her hair out of her face. “My mama worked for these here people to pay for her
passage. But then she had me and since she died right after, well, they said I had to work for em to pay it
off. I did, but now I want me some velvet.”
They did not look directly at each other, not straight into the eyes anyway. Yet they slipped
effortlessly into yard chat about nothing in particular—except one lay on the ground.
“Boston,” said Sethe. “Is that far?”
“Ooooh, yeah. A hundred miles. Maybe more.”
“Must be velvet closer by.”
“Not like in Boston. Boston got the best. Be so pretty on me. You ever touch it?”
“No, miss. I never touched no velvet.” Sethe didn’t know if it was the voice, or Boston or velvet, but
while the whitegirl talked, the baby slept. Not one butt or kick, so she guessed her luck had turned.
“Ever see any?” she asked Sethe. “I bet you never even seen any.”
“If I did I didn’t know it. What’s it like, velvet?”
Amy dragged her eyes over Sethe’s face as though she would never give out so confidential a piece of
information as that to a perfect stranger.
“What they call you?” she asked.
However far she was from Sweet Home, there was no point in giving out her real name to the first
person she saw. “Lu,” said Sethe. “They call me Lu.”
“Well, Lu, velvet is like the world was just born. Clean and new and so smooth. The velvet I seen was
brown, but in Boston they got all colors. Carmine. That means red but when you talk about velvet you got
to say ‘carmine.’” She raised her eyes to the sky and then, as though she had wasted enough time away
from Boston, she moved off saying, “I gotta go.”
Picking her way through the brush she hollered back to Sethe, “What you gonna do, just lay there and
foal?”
“I can’t get up from here,” said Sethe.
“What?” She stopped and turned to hear.
“I said I can’t get up.”
Amy drew her arm across her nose and came slowly back to where Sethe lay. “It’s a house back
yonder,” she said.
“A house?”
“Mmmmm. I passed it. Ain’t no regular house with people in it though. A lean-to, kinda.”
“How far?”
“Make a difference, does it? You stay the night here snake get you.”
“Well he may as well come on. I can’t stand up let alone walk and God help me, miss, I can’t crawl.”
“Sure you can, Lu. Come on,” said Amy and, with a toss of hair enough for five heads, she moved
toward the path.
So she crawled and Amy walked alongside her, and when Sethe needed to rest, Amy stopped too and
talked some more about Boston and velvet and good things to eat. The sound of that voice, like a sixteenyear-old boy’s, going on and on and on, kept the little antelope quiet and grazing. During the whole
hateful crawl to the lean-to, it never bucked once.
Nothing of Sethe’s was intact by the time they reached it except the cloth that covered her hair. Below
her bloody knees, there was no feeling at all; her chest was two cushions of pins. It was the voice full of
velvet and Boston and good things to eat that urged her along and made her think that maybe she wasn’t,
after all, just a crawling graveyard for a six-month baby’s last hours.
The lean-to was full of leaves, which Amy pushed into a pile for Sethe to lie on. Then she gathered
rocks, covered them with more leaves and made Sethe put her feet on them, saying: “I know a woman had
her feet cut off they was so swole.” And she made sawing gestures with the blade of her hand across
Sethe’s ankles. “Zzz Zzz Zzz Zzz.”
“I used to be a good size. Nice arms and everything. Wouldn’t think it, would you? That was before
they put me in the root cellar. I was fishing off the Beaver once. Catfish in Beaver River sweet as chicken.
Well I was just fishing there and a nigger floated right by me. I don’t like drowned people, you? Your feet
remind me of him. All swole like.”
Then she did the magic: lifted Sethe’s feet and legs and massaged them until she cried salt tears.
“It’s gonna hurt, now,” said Amy. “Anything dead coming back to life hurts.”
A truth for all times, thought Denver. Maybe the white dress holding its arm around her mother’s
waist was in pain. If so, it could mean the baby ghost had plans. When she opened the door, Sethe was just
leaving the keeping room.
“I saw a white dress holding on to you,” Denver said.
“White? Maybe it was my bedding dress. Describe it to me.”
“Had a high neck. Whole mess of buttons coming down the back.”
“Buttons. Well, that lets out my bedding dress. I never had a button on nothing.”
“Did Grandma Baby?”
Sethe shook her head. “She couldn’t handle them. Even on her shoes. What else?”
“A bunch at the back. On the sit-down part.”
“A bustle? It had a bustle?”
“I don’t know what it’s called.”
“Sort of gathered-like? Below the waist in the back?”
“Um hm.”
“A rich lady’s dress. Silk?”
“Cotton, look like.”
“Lisle probably. White cotton lisle. You say it was holding on to me. How?”
“Like you. It looked just like you. Kneeling next to you while you were praying. Had its arm around
your waist.”
“Well, I’ll be.”
“What were you praying for, Ma’am?”
“Not for anything. I don’t pray anymore. I just talk.”
“What were you talking about?”
“You won’t understand, baby.”
“Yes, I will.”
“I was talking about time. It’s so hard for me to believe in it. Some things go. Pass on. Some things
just stay. I used to think it was my rememory. You know. Some things you forget. Other things you never
do. But it’s not. Places, places are still there. If a house burns down, it’s gone, but the place—the picture
of it—stays, and not just in my rememory, but out there, in the world. What I remember is a picture
floating around out there outside my head. I mean, even if I don’t think it, even if I die, the picture of what
I did, or knew, or saw is still out there. Right in the place where it happened.”
“Can other people see it?” asked Denver.
“Oh, yes. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Someday you be walking down the road and you hear something or see
something going on. So clear. And you think it’s you thinking it up. A thought picture. But no. It’s when
you bump into a rememory that belongs to somebody else. Where I was before I came here, that place is
real. It’s never going away. Even if the whole farm—every tree and grass blade of it dies. The picture is
still there and what’s more, if you go there—you who never was there—if you go there and stand in the
place where it was, it will happen again; it will be there for you, waiting for you. So, Denver, you can’t
never go there. Never. Because even though it’s all over—over and done with—it’s going to always be
there waiting for you. That’s how come I had to get all my children out. No matter what.”
Denver picked at her fingernails. “If it’s still there, waiting, that must mean that nothing ever dies.”
Sethe looked right in Denver’s face. “Nothing ever does,” she said.
“You never told me all what happened. Just that they whipped you and you run off, pregnant. With
me.”
“Nothing to tell except schoolteacher. He was a little man. Short. Always wore a collar, even in the
fields. A schoolteacher, she said. That made her feel good that her husband’s sister’s husband had book
learning and was willing to come farm Sweet Home after Mr. Garner passed. The men could have done it,
even with Paul F sold. But it was like Halle said. She didn’t want to be the only white person on the farm
and a woman too. So she was satisfied when the schoolteacher agreed to come. He brought two boys with
him. Sons or nephews. I don’t know. They called him Onka and had pretty manners, all of em. Talked soft
and spit in handkerchiefs. Gentle in a lot of ways. You know, the kind who know Jesus by His first name,
but out of politeness never use it even to His face. A pretty good farmer, Halle said. Not strong as Mr.
Garner but smart enough. He liked the ink I made. It was her recipe, but he preferred how I mixed it and it
was important to him because at night he sat down to write in his book. It was a book about us but we
didn’t know that right away. We just thought it was his manner to ask us questions. He commenced to
carry round a notebook and write down what we said. I still think it was them questions that tore Sixo up.
Tore him up for all time.”
She stopped.
Denver knew that her mother was through with it—for now anyway. The single slow blink of her
eyes; the bottom lip sliding up slowly to cover the top; and then a nostril sigh, like the snuff of a candle
flame—signs that Sethe had reached the point beyond which she would not go.
“Well, I think the baby got plans,” said Denver.
“What plans?”
“I don’t know, but the dress holding on to you got to mean something.”
“Maybe,” said Sethe. “Maybe it does have plans.”
Whatever they were or might have been, Paul D messed them up for good. With a table and a loud
male voice he had rid 124 of its claim to local fame. Denver had taught herself to take pride in the
condemnation Negroes heaped on them; the assumption that the haunting was done by an evil thing
looking for more. None of them knew the downright pleasure of enchantment, of not suspecting but
knowing the things behind things. Her brothers had known, but it scared them; Grandma Baby knew, but it
saddened her. None could appreciate the safety of ghost company. Even Sethe didn’t love it. She just took
it for granted—like a sudden change in the weather.
But it was gone now. Whooshed away in the blast of a hazelnut man’s shout, leaving Denver’s world
flat, mostly, with the exception of an emerald closet standing seven feet high in the woods. Her mother
had secrets—things she wouldn’t tell; things she halfway told. Well, Denver had them too. And hers were
sweet—sweet as lily-of-the-valley cologne.
Sethe had given little thought to the white dress until Paul D came, and then she remembered Denver’s
interpretation: plans. The morning after the first night with Paul D, Sethe smiled just thinking about what
the word could mean. It was a luxury she had not had in eighteen years and only that once. Before and
since, all her effort was directed not on avoiding pain but on getting through it as quickly as possible. The
one set of plans she had made—getting away from Sweet Home—went awry so completely she never
dared life by making more.
Yet the morning she woke up next to Paul D, the word her daughter had used a few years ago did
cross her mind and she thought about what Denver had seen kneeling next to her, and thought also of the
temptation to trust and remember that gripped her as she stood before the cooking stove in his arms.
Would it be all right? Would it be all right to go ahead and feel? Go ahead and count on something?
She couldn’t think clearly, lying next to him listening to his breathing, so carefully, carefully, she had
left the bed.
Kneeling in the keeping room where she usually went to talk-think it was clear why Baby Suggs was
so starved for color. There wasn’t any except for two orange squares in a quilt that made the absence
shout. The walls of the room were slate-colored, the floor earth-brown, the wooden dresser the color of
itself, curtains white, and the dominating feature, the quilt over an iron cot, was made up of scraps of blue
serge, black, brown and gray wool—the full range of the dark and the muted that thrift and modesty
allowed. In that sober field, two patches of orange looked wild—like life in the raw.
Sethe looked at her hands, her bottle-green sleeves, and thought how little color there was in the house
and how strange that she had not missed it the way Baby did. Deliberate, she thought, it must be
deliberate, because the last color she remembered was the pink chips in the headstone of her baby girl.
After that she became as color conscious as a hen. Every dawn she worked at fruit pies, potato dishes and
vegetables while the cook did the soup, meat and all the rest. And she could not remember remembering a
molly apple or a yellow squash. Every dawn she saw the dawn, but never acknowledged or remarked its
color. There was something wrong with that. It was as though one day she saw red baby blood, another
day the pink gravestone chips, and that was the last of it.
124 was so full of strong feeling perhaps she was oblivious to the loss of anything at all. There was a
time when she scanned the fields every morning and every evening for her boys. When she stood at the
open window, unmindful of flies, her head cocked to her left shoulder, her eyes searching to the right for
them. Cloud shadow on the road, an old woman, a wandering goat untethered and gnawing bramble—
each one looked at first like Howard—no, Buglar. Little by little she stopped and their thirteen-year-old
faces faded completely into their baby ones, which came to her only in sleep. When her dreams roamed
outside 124, anywhere they wished, she saw them sometimes in beautiful trees, their little legs barely
visible in the leaves. Sometimes they ran along the railroad track laughing, too loud, apparently, to hear
her because they never did turn around. When she woke the house crowded in on her: there was the door
where the soda crackers were lined up in a row; the white stairs her baby girl loved to climb; the corner
where Baby Suggs mended shoes, a pile of which were still in the cold room; the exact place on the stove
where Denver burned her fingers. And of course the spite of the house itself. There was no room for any
other thing or body until Paul D arrived and broke up the place, making room, shifting it, moving it over
to someplace else, then standing in the place he had made.
So, kneeling in the keeping room the morning after Paul D came, she was distracted by the two orange
squares that signaled how barren 124 really was.
He was responsible for that. Emotions sped to the surface in his company. Things became what they
were: drabness looked drab; heat was hot. Windows suddenly had view. And wouldn’t you know he’d be
a singing man.
Little rice, little bean,
No meat in between.
Hard work ain’t easy,
Dry bread ain’t greasy.
He was up now and singing as he mended things he had broken the day before. Some old pieces of
song he’d learned on the prison farm or in the War afterward. Nothing like what they sang at Sweet Home,
where yearning fashioned every note.
The songs he knew from Georgia were flat-headed nails for pounding and pounding and pounding.
Lay my head on the railroad line,
Train come along, pacify my mind.
If I had my weight in lime,
I’d whip my captain till he went stone blind.
Five-cent nickel.
Ten-cent dime,
Busting rocks is busting time.
But they didn’t fit, these songs. They were too loud, had too much power for the little house chores he
was engaged in—resetting table legs; glazing.
He couldn’t go back to “Storm upon the Waters” that they sang under the trees of Sweet Home, so he
contented himself with mmmmmmmmm, throwing in a line if one occurred to him, and what occurred
over and over was “Bare feet and chamomile sap,/ Took off my shoes; took off my hat.”
It was tempting to change the words (Gimme back my shoes; gimme back my hat), because he didn’t
believe he could live with a woman—any woman—for over two out of three months. That was about as
long as he could abide one place. After Delaware and before that Alfred, Georgia, where he slept
underground and crawled into sunlight for the sole purpose of breaking rock, walking off when he got
ready was the only way he could convince himself that he would no longer have to sleep, pee, eat or swing
a sledge hammer in chains.
But this was not a normal woman in a normal house. As soon as he had stepped through the red light
he knew that, compared to 124, the rest of the world was bald. After Alfred he had shut down a generous
portion of his head, operating on the part that helped him walk, eat, sleep, sing. If he could do those
things—with a little work and a little sex thrown in—he asked for no more, for more required him to
dwell on Halle’s face and Sixo laughing. To recall trembling in a box built into the ground. Grateful for
the daylight spent doing mule work in a quarry because he did not tremble when he had a hammer in his
hands. The box had done what Sweet Home had not, what working like an ass and living like a dog had
not: drove him crazy so he would not lose his mind.
By the time he got to Ohio, then to Cincinnati, then to Halle Suggs’ mother’s house, he thought he had
seen and felt it all. Even now as he put back the window frame he had smashed, he could not account for
the pleasure in his surprise at seeing Halle’s wife alive, barefoot with uncovered hair—walking around the
corner of the house with her shoe and stockings in her hands. The closed portion of his head opened like a
greased lock.
“I was thinking of looking for work around here. What you think?”
“Ain’t much. River mostly. And hogs.”
“Well, I never worked on water, but I can pick up anything heavy as me, hogs included.”
“Whitepeople better here than Kentucky but you may have to scramble some.”
“It ain’t whether I scramble; it’s where. You saying it’s all right to scramble here?”
“Better than all right.”
“Your girl, Denver. Seems to me she’s of a different mind.”
“Why you say that?”
“She’s got a waiting way about her. Something she’s expecting and it ain’t me.”
“I don’t know what it could be.”
“Well, whatever it is, she believes I’m interrupting it.”
“Don’t worry about her. She’s a charmed child. From the beginning.”
“Is that right?”
“Uh huh. Nothing bad can happen to her. Look at it. Everybody I knew dead or gone or dead and
gone. Not her. Not my Denver. Even when I was carrying her, when it got clear that I wasn’t going to
make it—which meant she wasn’t going to make it either—she pulled a whitegirl out of the hill. The last
thing you’d expect to help. And when the schoolteacher found us and came busting in here with the law
and a shotgun—”
“Schoolteacher found you?”
“Took a while, but he did. Finally.”
“And he didn’t take you back?”
“Oh, no. I wasn’t going back there. I don’t care who found who. Any life but not that one. I went to
jail instead. Denver was just a baby so she went right along with me. Rats bit everything in there but her.”
Paul D turned away. He wanted to know more about it, but jail talk put him back in Alfred, Georgia.
“I need some nails. Anybody around here I can borrow from or should I go to town?”
“May as well go to town. You’ll need other things.”
One night and they were talking like a couple. They had skipped love and promise and went directly to
“You saying it’s all right to scramble here?”
To Sethe, the future was a matter of keeping the past at bay. The “better life” she believed she and
Denver were living was simply not that other one.
The fact that Paul D had come out of “that other one” into her bed was better too; and the notion of a
future with him, or for that matter without him, was beginning to stroke her mind. As for Denver, the job
Sethe had of keeping her from the past that was still waiting for her was all that mattered.
PLEASANTLY TROUBLED, Sethe avoided the keeping room and Denver’s sidelong looks. As she
expected, since life was like that—it didn’t do any good. Denver ran a mighty interference and on the third
day flat-out asked Paul D how long he was going to hang around.
The phrase hurt him so much he missed the table. The coffee cup hit the floor and rolled down the
sloping boards toward the front door.
“Hang around?” Paul D didn’t even look at the mess he had made.
“Denver! What’s got into you?” Sethe looked at her daughter, feeling more embarrassed than angry.
Paul D scratched the hair on his chin. “Maybe I should make tracks.”
“No!” Sethe was surprised by how loud she said it.
“He know what he needs,” said Denver.
“Well, you don’t,” Sethe told her, “and you must not know what you need either. I don’t want to hear
another word out of you.”
“I just asked if—“
“Hush! You make tracks. Go somewhere and sit down.”
Denver picked up her plate and left the table but not before adding a chicken back and more bread to
the heap she was carrying away. Paul D leaned over to wipe the spilled coffee with his blue handkerchief.
“I’ll get that.” Sethe jumped up and went to the stove. Behind it various cloths hung, each in some
stage of drying. In silence she wiped the floor and retrieved the cup. Then she poured him another cupful,
and set it carefully before him. Paul D touched its rim but didn’t say anything—as though even “thank
you” was an obligation he could not meet and the coffee itself a gift he could not take.
Sethe resumed her chair and the silence continued. Finally she realized that if it was going to be
broken she would have to do it.
“I didn’t train her like that.”
Paul D stroked the rim of the cup.
“And I’m as surprised by her manners as you are hurt by em.”
Paul D looked at Sethe. “Is there history to her question?”
“History? What you mean?”
“I mean, did she have to ask that, or want to ask it, of anybody else before me?”
Sethe made two fists and placed them on her hips. “You as bad as she is.”
“Come on, Sethe.”
“Oh, I am coming on. I am!”
“You know what I mean.”
“I do and I don’t like it.”
“Jesus,” he whispered.
“Who?” Sethe was getting loud again.
“Jesus! I said Jesus! All I did was sit down for supper! and I get cussed out twice. Once for being here
and once for asking why I was cussed in the first place!”
“She didn’t cuss.”
“No? Felt like it.”
“Look here. I apologize for her. I’m real—”
“You can’t do that. You can’t apologize for nobody. She got to do that.”
“Then I’ll see that she does.” Sethe sighed.
“What I want to know is, is she asking a question that’s on your mind too?”
“Oh no. No, Paul D. Oh no.”
“Then she’s of one mind and you another? If you can call whatever’s in her head a mind, that is.”
“Excuse me, but I can’t hear a word against her. I’ll chastise her. You leave her alone.”
Risky, thought Paul D, very risky. For a used-to-be-slave woman to love anything that much was
dangerous, especially if it was her children she had settled on to love. The best thing, he knew, was to love
just a little bit; everything, just a little bit, so when they broke its back, or shoved it in a croaker sack, well,
maybe you’d have a little love left over for the next one. “Why?” he asked her. “Why you think you have
to take up for her? Apologize for her? She’s grown.”
“I don’t care what she is. Grown don’t mean nothing to a mother. A child is a child. They get bigger,
older, but grown? What’s that supposed to mean? In my heart it don’t mean a thing.”
“It means she has to take it if she acts up. You can’t protect her every minute. What’s going to happen
when you die?”
“Nothing! I’ll protect her while I’m live and I’ll protect her when I ain’t.”
“Oh well, I’m through,” he said. “I quit.”
“That’s the way it is, Paul D. I can’t explain it to you no better than that, but that’s the way it is. If I
have to choose—well, it’s not even a choice.”
“That’s the point. The whole point. I’m not asking you to choose. Nobody would. I thought—well, I
thought you could—there was some space for me.”
“She’s asking me.”
“You can’t go by that. You got to say it to her. Tell her it’s not about choosing somebody over her—
it’s making space for somebody along with her. You got to say it. And if you say it and mean it, then you
also got to know you can’t gag me. There’s no way I’m going to hurt her or not take care of what she need
if I can, but I can’t be told to keep my mouth shut if she’s acting ugly. You want me here, don’t put no gag
on me.”
“Maybe I should leave things the way they are,” she said.
“How are they?”
“We get along.”
“What about inside?”
“I don’t go inside.”
“Sethe, if I’m here with you, with Denver, you can go anywhere you want. Jump, if you want to,
’cause I’ll catch you, girl. I’ll catch you ’fore you fall. Go as far inside as you need to, I’ll hold your
ankles. Make sure you get back out. I’m not saying this because I need a place to stay. That’s the last thing
I need. I told you, I’m a walking man, but I been heading in this direction for seven years. Walking all
around this place. Upstate, downstate, east, west; I been in territory ain’t got no name, never staying
nowhere long. But when I got here and sat out there on the porch, waiting for you, well, I knew it wasn’t
the place I was heading toward; it was you. We can make a life, girl. A life.”
“I don’t know. I don’t know.”
“Leave it to me. See how it goes. No promises, if you don’t want to make any. Just see how it goes.
All right?”
“All right.”
“You willing to leave it to me?”
“Well—some of it.”
“Some?” he smiled. “Okay. Here’s some. There’s a carnival in town. Thursday, tomorrow, is for
coloreds and I got two dollars. Me and you and Denver gonna spend every penny of it. What you say?”
“No” is what she said. At least what she started out saying (what would her boss say if she took a day
off?), but even when she said it she was thinking how much her eyes enjoyed looking in his face.
The crickets were screaming on Thursday and the sky, stripped of blue, was white hot at eleven in the
morning. Sethe was badly dressed for the heat, but this being her first social outing in eighteen years, she
felt obliged to wear her one good dress, heavy as it was, and a hat. Certainly a hat. She didn’t want to meet
Lady Jones or Ella with her head wrapped like she was going to work. The dress, a good-wool castoff,
was a Christmas present to Baby Suggs from Miss Bodwin, the whitewoman who loved her. Denver and
Paul D fared better in the heat since neither felt the occasion required special clothing. Denver’s bonnet
knocked against her shoulder blades; Paul D wore his vest open, no jacket and his shirt sleeves rolled
above his elbows. They were not holding hands, but their shadows were. Sethe looked to her left and all
three of them were gliding over the dust holding hands. Maybe he was right. A life. Watching their handholding shadows, she was embarrassed at being dressed for church. The others, ahead and behind them,
would think she was putting on airs, letting them know that she was different because she lived in a house
with two stories; tougher, because she could do and survive things they believed she should neither do nor
survive. She was glad Denver had resisted her urgings to dress up—rebraid her hair at least. But Denver
was not doing anything to make this trip a pleasure. She agreed to go—sullenly—but her attitude was “Go
’head. Try and make me happy.” The happy one was Paul D. He said howdy to everybody within twenty
feet. Made fun of the weather and what it was doing to him, yelled back at the crows, and was the first to
smell the doomed roses. All the time, no matter what they were doing—whether Denver wiped
perspiration from her forehead or stooped to retie her shoes; whether Paul D kicked a stone or reached
over to meddle a child’s face leaning on its mother’s shoulder—all the time the three shadows that shot
out of their feet to the left held hands. Nobody noticed but Sethe and she stopped looking after she decided
that it was a good sign. A life. Could be.
Up and down the lumberyard fence old roses were dying. The sawyer who had planted them twelve
years ago to give his workplace a friendly feel—something to take the sin out of slicing trees for a
living—was amazed by their abundance; how rapidly they crawled all over the stake-and-post fence that
separated the lumberyard from the open field next to it where homeless men slept, children ran and, once a
year, carnival people pitched tents. The closer the roses got to death, the louder their scent, and everybody
who attended the carnival associated it with the stench of the rotten roses. It made them a little dizzy and
very thirsty but did nothing to extinguish the eagerness of the colored people filing down the road. Some
walked on the grassy shoulders, others dodged the wagons creaking down the road’s dusty center. All, like
Paul D, were in high spirits, which the smell of dying roses (that Paul D called to everybody’s attention)
could not dampen. As they pressed to get to the rope entrance they were lit like lamps. Breathless with the
excitement of seeing whitepeople loose: doing magic, clowning, without heads or with two heads, twenty
feet tall or two feet tall, weighing a ton, completely tattooed, eating glass, swallowing fire, spitting
ribbons, twisted into knots, forming pyramids, playing with snakes and beating each other up.
All of this was advertisement, read by those who could and heard by those who could not, and the fact
that none of it was true did not extinguish their appetite a bit. The barker called them and their children
names (“Pickaninnies free!”) but the food on his vest and the hole in his pants rendered it fairly harmless.
In any case it was a small price to pay for the fun they might not ever have again. Two pennies and an
insult were well spent if it meant seeing the spectacle of whitefolks making a spectacle of themselves. So,
although the carnival was a lot less than mediocre (which is why it agreed to a Colored Thursday), it gave
the four hundred black people in its audience thrill upon thrill upon thrill.
One-Ton Lady spit at them, but her bulk shortened her aim and they got a big kick out of the helpless
meanness in her little eyes. Arabian Nights Dancer cut her performance to three minutes instead of the
usual fifteen she normally did—earning the gratitude of the children, who could hardly wait for Abu
Snake Charmer, who followed her.
Denver bought horehound, licorice, peppermint and lemonade at a table manned by a little whitegirl in
ladies’ high-topped shoes. Soothed by sugar, surrounded by a crowd of people who did not find her the
main attraction, who, in fact, said, “Hey, Denver,” every now and then, pleased her enough to consider the
possibility that Paul D wasn’t all that bad. In fact there was something about him when the three of them
stood together watching Midget dance-that made the stares of other Negroes kind, gentle, something
Denver did not remember seeing in their faces. Several even nodded and smiled at her mother, no one,
apparently, able to withstand sharing the pleasure Paul D was having. He slapped his knees when Giant
danced with Midget; when Two-Headed Man talked to himself. He bought everything Denver asked for
and much she did not. He teased Sethe into tents she was reluctant to enter. Stuck pieces of candy she
didn’t want between her lips. When Wild African Savage shook his bars and said wa wa, Paul D told
everybody he knew him back in Roanoke.
Paul D made a few acquaintances; spoke to them about what work he might find. Sethe returned the
smiles she got. Denver was swaying with delight. And on the way home, although leading them now, the
shadows of three people still held hands.
A FULLY DRESSED woman walked out of the water. She barely gained the dry bank of the stream
before she sat down and leaned against a mulberry tree. All day and all night she sat there, her head
resting on the trunk in a position abandoned enough to crack the brim in her straw hat. Everything hurt but
her lungs most of all. Sopping wet and breathing shallow she spent those hours trying to negotiate the
weight of her eyelids. The day breeze blew her dress dry; the night wind wrinkled it. Nobody saw her
emerge or came accidentally by. If they had, chances are they would have hesitated before approaching
her. Not because she was wet, or dozing or had what sounded like asthma, but because amid all that she
was smiling. It took her the whole of the next morning to lift herself from the ground and make her way
through the woods past a giant temple of boxwood to the field and then the yard of the slate-gray house.
Exhausted again, she sat down on the first handy place—a stump not far from the steps of 124. By then
keeping her eyes open was less of an effort. She could manage it for a full two minutes or more. Her neck,
its circumference no wider than a parlor-service saucer, kept bending and her chin brushed the bit of lace
edging her dress.
Women who drink champagne when there is nothing to celebrate can look like that: their straw hats
with broken brims are often askew; they nod in public places; their shoes are undone. But their skin is not
like that of the woman breathing near the steps of 124. She had new skin, lineless and smooth, including
the knuckles of her hands.
By late afternoon when the carnival was over, and the Negroes were hitching rides home if they were
lucky—walking if they were not—the woman had fallen asleep again. The rays of the sun struck her full
in the face, so that when Sethe, Denver and Paul D rounded the curve in the road all they saw was a black
dress, two unlaced shoes below it, and Here Boy nowhere in sight.
“Look,” said Denver. “What is that?”
And, for some reason she could not immediately account for, the moment she got close enough to see
the face, Sethe’s bladder filled to capacity. She said, “Oh, excuse me,” and ran around to the back of 124.
Not since she was a baby girl, being cared for by the eight-year-old girl who pointed out her mother to her,
had she had an emergency that unmanageable. She never made the outhouse. Right in front of its door she
had to lift her skirts, and the water she voided was endless. Like a horse, she thought, but as it went on and
on she thought, No, more like flooding the boat when Denver was born. So much water Amy said, “Hold
on, Lu. You going to sink us you keep that up.” But there was no stopping water breaking from a breaking
womb and there was no stopping now. She hoped Paul D wouldn’t take it upon himself to come looking
for her and be obliged to see her squatting in front of her own privy making a mudhole too deep to be
witnessed without shame. Just about the time she started wondering if the carnival would accept another
freak, it stopped. She tidied herself and ran around to the porch. No one was there. All three were inside—
Paul D and Denver standing before the stranger, watching her drink cup after cup of water.
“She said she was thirsty,” said Paul D. He took off his cap. “Mighty thirsty look like.”
The woman gulped water from a speckled tin cup and held it out for more. Four times Denver filled it,
and four times the woman drank as though she had crossed a desert. When she was finished a little water
was on her chin, but she did not wipe it away. Instead she gazed at Sethe with sleepy eyes. Poorly fed,
thought Sethe, and younger than her clothes suggested—good lace at the throat, and a rich woman’s hat.
Her skin was flawless except for three vertical scratches on her forehead so fine and thin they scemed at
first like hair, baby hair before it bloomed and roped into the masses of black yarn under her hat.
“You from around here?” Sethe asked her.
She shook her head no and reached down to take off her shoes. She pulled her dress up to the knees
and rolled down her stockings. When the hosiery was tucked into the shoes, Sethe saw that her feet were
like her hands, soft and new. She must have hitched a wagon ride, thought Sethe. Probably one of those
West Virginia girls looking for something to beat a life of tobacco and sorghum. Sethe bent to pick up the
shoes.
“What might your name be?” asked Paul D.
“Beloved,” she said, and her voice was so low and rough each one looked at the other two. They heard
the voice first—later the name.
“Beloved. You use a last name, Beloved?” Paul D asked her.
“Last?” She seemed puzzled. Then “No,” and she spelled it for them, slowly as though the letters were
being formed as she spoke them.
Sethe dropped the shoes; Denver sat down and Paul D smiled. He recognized the careful enunciation
of letters by those, like himself, who could not read but had memorized the letters of their name. He was
about to ask who her people were but thought better of it. A young coloredwoman drifting was drifting
from ruin. He had been in Rochester four years ago and seen five women arriving with fourteen female
children. All their men—brothers, uncles, fathers, husbands, sons—had been picked off one by one by
one. They had a single piece of paper directing them to a preacher on DeVore Street. The War had been
over four or five years then, but nobody white or black seemed to know it. Odd clusters and strays of
Negroes wandered the back roads and cowpaths from Schenectady to Jackson. Dazed but insistent, they
searched each other out for word of a cousin, an aunt, a friend who once said, “Call on me. Anytime you
get near Chicago, just call on me.” Some of them were running from family that could not support them,
some to family; some were running from dead crops, dead kin, life threats, and took-over land. Boys
younger than Buglar and Howard; configurations and blends of families of women and children, while
elsewhere, solitary, hunted and hunting for, were men, men, men. Forbidden public transportation, chased
by debt and filthy “talking sheets,” they followed secondary routes, scanned the horizon for signs and
counted heavily on each other. Silent, except for social courtesies, when they met one another they neither
described nor asked about the sorrow that drove them from one place to another. The whites didn’t bear
speaking on. Everybody knew.
So he did not press the young woman with the broken hat about where from or how come. If she
wanted them to know and was strong enough to get through the telling, she would. What occupied them at
the moment was what it might be that she needed. Underneath the major question, each harbored another.
Paul D wondered at the newness of her shoes. Sethe was deeply touched by her sweet name; the
remembrance of glittering headstone made her feel especially kindly toward her. Denver, however, was
shaking. She looked at this sleepy beauty and wanted more.
Sethe hung her hat on a peg and turned graciously toward the girl. “That’s a pretty name, Beloved.
Take off your hat, why don’t you, and I’ll make us something. We just got back from the carnival over
near Cincinnati. Everything in there is something to see.”
Bolt upright in the chair, in the middle of Sethe’s welcome, Beloved had fallen asleep again.
“Miss. Miss.” Paul D shook her gently. “You want to lay down a spell?”
She opened her eyes to slits and stood up on her soft new feet which, barely capable of their job,
slowly bore her to the keeping room. Once there, she collapsed on Baby Suggs’ bed. Denver removed her
hat and put the quilt with two squares of color over her feet. She was breathing like a steam engine.
“Sounds like croup,” said Paul D, closing the door.
“Is she feverish? Denver, could you tell?”
“No. She’s cold.”
“Then she is. Fever goes from hot to cold.”
“Could have the cholera,” said Paul D.
“Reckon?”
“All that water. Sure sign.”
“Poor thing. And nothing in this house to give her for it. She’ll just have to ride it out. That’s a hateful
sickness if ever there was one.”
“She’s not sick!” said Denver, and the passion in her voice made them smile.
Four days she slept, waking and sitting up only for water. Denver tended her, watched her sound sleep,
listened to her labored breathing and, out of love and a breakneck possessiveness that charged her, hid like
a personal blemish Beloved’s incontinence. She rinsed the sheets secretly, after Sethe went to the
restaurant and Paul D went scrounging for barges to help unload. She boiled the underwear and soaked it
in bluing, praying the fever would pass without damage. So intent was her nursing, she forgot to eat or
visit the emerald closet.
“Beloved?” Denver would whisper. “Beloved?” and when the black eyes opened a slice all she could
say was “I’m here. I’m still here.”
Sometimes, when Beloved lay dreamy-eyed for a very long time, saying nothing, licking her lips and
heaving deep sighs, Denver panicked. “What is it?” she would ask.
“Heavy,” murmured Beloved. “This place is heavy.”
“Would you like to sit up?”
“No,” said the raspy voice.
It took three days for Beloved to notice the orange patches in the darkness of the quilt. Denver was
pleased because it kept her patient awake longer. She seemed totally taken with those faded scraps of
orange, even made the effort to lean on her elbow and stroke them. An effort that quickly exhausted her,
so Denver rearranged the quilt so its cheeriest part was in the sick girl’s sight line.
Patience, something Denver had never known, overtook her. As long as her mother did not interfere,
she was a model of compassion, turning waspish, though, when Sethe tried to help.
“Did she take a spoonful of anything today?” Sethe inquired.
“She shouldn’t eat with cholera.”
“You sure that’s it? Was just a hunch of Paul D’s.”
“I don’t know, but she shouldn’t eat anyway just yet.”
“I think cholera people puke all the time.”
“That’s even more reason, ain’t it?”
“Well she shouldn’t starve to death either, Denver.”
“Leave us alone, Ma’am. I’m taking care of her.”
“She say anything?”
“I’d let you know if she did.”
Sethe looked at her daughter and thought, Yes, she has been lonesome. Very lonesome.
“Wonder where Here Boy got off to?” Sethe thought a change of subject was needed.
“He won’t be back,” said Denver.
“How you know?”
“I just know.” Denver took a square of sweet bread off the plate.
Back in the keeping room, Denver was about to sit down when Beloved’s eyes flew wide open.
Denver felt her heart race. It wasn’t that she was looking at that face for the first time with no trace of
sleep in it, or that the eyes were big and black. Nor was it that the whites of them were much too white—
blue-white. It was that deep down in those big black eyes there was no expression at all.
“Can I get you something?”
Beloved looked at the sweet bread in Denver’s hands and Denver held it out to her. She smiled then
and Denver’s heart stopped bouncing and sat down—relieved and easeful like a traveler who had made it
home.
From that moment and through everything that followed, sugar could always be counted on to please
her. It was as though sweet things were what she was born for. Honey as well as the wax it came in, sugar
sandwiches, the sludgy molasses gone hard and brutal in the can, lemonade, taffy and any type of dessert
Sethe brought home from the restaurant. She gnawed a cane stick to flax and kept the strings in her mouth
long after the syrup had been sucked away. Denver laughed, Sethe smiled and Paul D said it made him
sick to his stomach.
Sethe believed it was a recovering body’s need—after an illness—for quick strength. But it was a need
that went on and on into glowing health because Beloved didn’t go anywhere. There didn’t seem anyplace
for her to go. She didn’t mention one, or have much of an idea of what she was doing in that part of the
country or where she had been. They believed the fever had caused her memory to fail just as it kept her
slow-moving. A young woman, about nineteen or twenty, and slender, she moved like a heavier one or an
older one, holding on to furniture, resting her head in the palm of her hand as though it was too heavy for
a neck alone.
“You just gonna feed her? From now on?” Paul D, feeling ungenerous, and surprised by it, heard the
irritability in his voice.
“Denver likes her. She’s no real trouble. I thought we’d wait till her breath was better. She still sounds
a little lumbar to me.”
“Something funny ’bout that gal,” Paul D said, mostly to himself.
“Funny how?”
“Acts sick, sounds sick, but she don’t look sick. Good skin, bright eyes and strong as a bull.”
“She’s not strong. She can hardly walk without holding on to something.”
“That’s what I mean. Can’t walk, but I seen her pick up the rocker with one hand.”
“You didn’t.”
“Don’t tell me. Ask Denver. She was right there with her.”
“Denver! Come in here a minute.”
Denver stopped rinsing the porch and stuck her head in the window.
“Paul D says you and him saw Beloved pick up the rocking chair single-handed. That so?”
Long, heavy lashes made Denver’s eyes seem busier than they were; deceptive, even when she held a
steady gaze as she did now on Paul D. “No,” she said. “I didn’t see no such thing.”
Paul D frowned but said nothing. If there had been an open latch between them, it would have closed.
RAINWATER held on to pine needles for dear life and Beloved could not take her eyes off Sethe.
Stooping to shake the damper, or snapping sticks for kindlin, Sethe was licked, tasted, eaten by Beloved’s
eyes. Like a familiar, she hovered, never leaving the room Sethe was in unless required and told to. She
rose early in the dark to be there, waiting, in the kitchen when Sethe came down to make fast bread before
she left for work. In lamplight, and over the flames of the cooking stove, their two shadows clashed and
crossed on the ceiling like black swords. She was in the window at two when Sethe returned, or the
doorway; then the porch, its steps, the path, the road, till finally, surrendering to the habit, Beloved began
inching down Bluestone Road further and further each day to meet Sethe and walk her back to 124. It was
as though every afternoon she doubted anew the older woman’s return.
Sethe was flattered by Beloved’s open, quiet devotion. The same adoration from her daughter (had it
been forthcoming) would have annoyed her; made her chill at the thought of having raised a ridiculously
dependent child. But the company of this sweet, if peculiar, guest pleased her the way a zealot pleases his
teacher.
Time came when lamps had to be lit early because night arrived sooner and sooner. Sethe was leaving
for work in the dark; Paul D was walking home in it. On one such evening dark and cool, Sethe cut a
rutabaga into four pieces and left them stewing. She gave Denver a half peck of peas to sort and soak
overnight. Then she sat herself down to rest. The heat of the stove made her drowsy and she was sliding
into sleep when she felt Beloved touch her. A touch no heavier than a feather but loaded, nevertheless,
with desire. Sethe stirred and looked around. First at Beloved’s soft new hand on her shoulder, then into
her eyes. The longing she saw there was bottomless. Some plea barely in control. Sethe patted Beloved’s
fingers and glanced at Denver, whose eyes were fixed on her pea-sorting task.
“Where your diamonds?” Beloved searched Sethe’s face.
“Diamonds? What would I be doing with diamonds?”
“On your ears.”
“Wish I did. I had some crystal once. A present from a lady I worked for.”
“Tell me,” said Beloved, smiling a wide happy smile. ‘Tell me your diamonds.”
It became a way to feed her. Just as Denver discovered and relied on the delightful effect sweet things
had on Beloved, Sethe learned the profound satisfaction Beloved got from storytelling. It amazed Sethe
(as much as it pleased Beloved) because every mention of her past life hurt. Everything in it was painful
or lost. She and Baby Suggs had agreed without saying so that it was unspeakable; to Denver’s inquiries
Sethe gave short replies or rambling incomplete reveries. Even with Paul D, who had shared some of it
and to whom she could talk with at least a measure of calm, the hurt was always there—like a tender place
in the corner of her mouth that the bit left.
But, as she began telling about the earrings, she found herself wanting to, liking it. Perhaps it was
Beloved’s distance from the events itself, or her thirst for hearing it—in any case it was an unexpected
pleasure.
Above the patter of the pea sorting and the sharp odor of cooking rutabaga, Sethe explained the crystal
that once hung from her ears.
“That lady I worked for in Kentucky gave them to me when I got married. What they called married
back there and back then. I guess she saw how bad I felt when I found out there wasn’t going to be no
ceremony, no preacher. Nothing. I thought there should be something—something to say it was right and
true. I didn’t want it to be just me moving over a bit of pallet full of corn husks. Or just me bringing my
night bucket into his cabin. I thought there should be some ceremony. Dancing maybe. A little sweet
william in my hair.” Sethe smiled. “I never saw a wedding, but I saw Mrs. Garner’s wedding gown in the
press, and heard her go on about what it was like. Two pounds of currants in the cake, she said, and four
whole sheep. The people were still eating the next day. That’s what I wanted. A meal maybe, where me
and Halle and all the Sweet Home men sat down and ate something special. Invite some of the other
coloredpeople from over by Covington or High Trees—those places Sixo used to sneak off to. But it
wasn’t going to be nothing. They said it was all right for us to be husband and wife and that was it. All of
it.
“Well, I made up my mind to have at the least a dress that wasn’t the sacking I worked in. So I took to
stealing fabric, and wound up with a dress you wouldn’t believe. Te top was from two pillow cases in her
mending basket. The front of the skirt was a dresser scarf a candle fell on and burnt a hole in, and one of
her old sashes we used to test the flatiron on. Now the back was a problem for the longest time. Seem like
I couldn’t find a thing that wouldn’t be missed right away. Because I had to take it apart afterwards and
put all the pieces back where they were. Now Halle was patient, waiting for me to finish it. He knew I
wouldn’t go ahead without having it. Finally I took the mosquito netting from a nail out the barn. We used
it to strain jelly through. I washed it and soaked it best I could and tacked it on for the back of the skirt.
And there I was, in the worst-looking gown you could imagine. Only my wool shawl kept me from
looking like a haint peddling. I wasn’t but fourteen years old, so I reckon that’s why I was so proud of
myself.
“Anyhow, Mrs. Garner must have seen me in it. I thought I was stealing smart, and she knew
everything I did. Even our honeymoon: going down to the cornfield with HaIle. That’s where we went
first. A Saturday afternoon it was. He begged sick so he wouldn’t have to go work in town that day.
Usually he worked Saturdays and Sundays to pay off Baby Suggs’ freedom. But he begged sick and I put
on my dress and we walked into the corn holding hands. I can still smell the ears roasting yonder where
the Pauls and Sixo was. Next day Mrs. Garner crooked her finger at me and took me upstairs to her
bedroom. She opened up a wooden box and took out a pair of crystal earrings. She said, ‘I want you to
have these, Sethe.’ I said, ‘Yes, ma’am.’ ‘Are your ears pierced?’ she said. I said, ‘No, ma’am.’ ‘Well do
it,’ she said, ‘so you can wear them. I want you to have them and I want you and Halle to be happy.’ I
thanked her but I never did put them on till I got away from there. One day after I walked into this here
house Baby Suggs unknotted my underskirt and took em out. I sat right here by the stove with Denver in
my arms and let her punch holes in my ears for to wear them.”
“I never saw you in no earrings,” said Denver. “Where are they now?”
“Gone,” said Sethe. “Long gone,” and she wouldn’t say another word. Until the next time when all
three of them ran through the wind back into the house with rainsoaked sheets and petticoats. Panting,
laughing, they draped the laundry over the chairs and table. Beloved filled herself with water from the
bucket and watched while Sethe rubbed Denver’s hair with a piece of toweling.
“Maybe we should unbraid it?” asked Sethe.
“Uh uh. Tomorrow.” Denver crouched forward at the thought of a fine-tooth comb pulling her hair.
“Today is always here,” said Sethe. “Tomorrow, never.”
“It hurts,” Denver said.
“Comb it every day, it won’t.”
“Ouch.”
“Your woman she never fix up your hair?” Beloved asked.
Sethe and Denver looked up at her. After four weeks they still had not got used to the gravelly voice
and the song that seemed to lie in it. Just outside music it lay, with a cadence not like theirs.
“Your woman she never fix up your hair?” was clearly a question for Sethe, since that’s who she was
looking at.
“My woman? You mean my mother? If she did, I don’t remember. I didn’t see her but a few times out
in the fields and once when she was working indigo. By the time I woke up in the morning, she was in
line. If the moon was bright they worked by its light. Sunday she slept like a stick. She must of nursed me
two or three weeks—that’s the way the others did. Then she went back in rice and I sucked from another
woman whose job it was. So to answer you, no. I reckon not. She never fixed my hair nor nothing. She
didn’t even sleep in the same cabin most nights I remember. Too far from the line-up, I guess. One thing
she did do. She picked me up and carried me behind the smokehouse. Back there she opened up her dress
front and lifted her breast and pointed under it. Right on her rib was a circle and a cross burnt right in the
skin. She said, ‘This is your ma’am. This,’ and she pointed. ‘I am the only one got this mark now. The rest
dead. If something happens to me and you can’t tell me by my face, you can know me by this mark.’
Scared me so. All I could think of was how important this was and how I needed to have something
important to say back, but I couldn’t think of anything so I just said what I thought. ‘Yes, Ma’am,’ I said.
‘But how will you know me? How will you know me? Mark me, too,’ I said. ‘Mark the mark on me too.’”
Sethe chuckled.
“Did she?” asked Denver.
“She slapped my face.”
“What for?”
“I didn’t understand it then. Not till I had a mark of my own.”
“What happened to her?”
“Hung. By the time they cut her down nobody could tell whether she had a circle and a cross or not,
least of all me and I did look.” Sethe gathered hair from the comb and leaning back tossed it into the fire.
It exploded into stars and the smell infuriated them. “Oh, my Jesus,” she said and stood up so suddenly the
comb she had parked in Denver’s hair fell to the floor.
“Ma’am? What’s the matter with you, Ma’am?”
Sethe walked over to a chair, lifted a sheet and stretched it as wide as her arms would go. Then she
folded, refolded and double-folded it. She took another. Neither was completely dry but the folding felt
too fine to stop. She had to do something with her hands because she was remembering something she had
forgotten she knew. Something privately shameful that had seeped into a slit in her mind right behind the
slap on her face and the circled cross.
“Why they hang your ma’am?” Denver asked. This was the first time she had heard anything about her
mother’s mother. Baby Suggs was the only grandmother she knew.
“I never found out. It was a lot of them,” she said, but what was getting clear and clearer as she folded
and refolded damp laundry was the woman called Nan who took her hand and yanked her away from the
pile before she could make out the mark. Nan was the one she knew best, who was around all day, who
nursed babies, cooked, had one good arm and half of another. And who used different words. Words Sethe
understood then but could neither recall nor repeat now. She believed that must be why she remembered
so little before Sweet Home except singing and dancing and how crowded it was. What Nan told her she
had forgotten, along with the language she told it in. The same language her ma’am spoke, and which
would never come back. But the message—that was and had been there all along. Holding the damp white
sheets against her chest, she was picking meaning out of a code she no longer understood. Nighttime. Nan
holding her with her good arm, waving the stump of the other in the air. “Telling you. I am telling you,
small girl Sethe,” and she did that. She told Sethe that her mother and Nan were together from the sea.
Both were taken up many times by the crew. “She threw them all away but you. The one from the crew
she threw away on the island. The others from more whites she also threw away. Without names, she
threw them. You she gave the name of the black man. She put her arms around him. The others she did
not put her arms around. Never. Never. Telling you. I am telling you, small girl Sethe.”
As small girl Sethe, she was unimpressed. As grown-up woman Sethe she was angry, but not certain at
what. A mighty wish for Baby Suggs broke over her like surf. In the quiet following its splash, Sethe
looked at the two girls sitting by the stove: her sickly, shallow-minded boarder, her irritable, lonely
daughter. They seemed little and far away.
“Paul D be here in a minute,” she said.
Denver sighed with relief. For a minute there, while her mother stood folding the wash lost in thought,
she clamped her teeth and prayed it would stop. Denver hated the stories her mother told that did not
concern herself, which is why Amy was all she ever asked about. The rest was a gleaming, powerful world
made more so by Denver’s absence from it. Not being in it, she hated it and wanted Beloved to hate it too,
although there was no chance of that at all. Beloved took every opportunity to ask some funny question
and get Sethe going. Denver noticed how greedy she was to hear Sethe talk. Now she noticed something
more. The questions Beloved asked: “Where your diamonds?” “Your woman she never fix up your hair?”
And most perplexing: Tell me your earrings.
How did she know?
BELOVED WAS shining and Paul D didn’t like it. Women did what strawberry plants did before they
shot out their thin vines: the quality of the green changed. Then the vine threads came, then the buds. By
the time the white petals died and the mint-colored berry poked out, the leaf shine was gilded tight and
waxy. That’s how Beloved looked—gilded and shining. Paul D took to having Sethe on waking, so that
later, when he went down the white stairs where she made bread under Beloved’s gaze, his head was clear.
In the evening when he came home and the three of them were all there fixing the supper table, her
shine was so pronounced he wondered why Denver and Sethe didn’t see it. Or maybe they did. Certainly
women could tell, as men could, when one of their number was aroused. Paul D looked carefully at
Beloved to see if she was aware of it but she paid him no attention at all—frequently not even answering a
direct question put to her. She would look at him and not open her mouth. Five weeks she had been with
them, and they didn’t know any more about her than they did when they found her asleep on the stump.
They were seated at the table Paul D had broken the day he arrived at 124. Its mended legs stronger
than before. The cabbage was all gone and the shiny ankle bones of smoked pork were pushed in a heap
on their plates. Sethe was dishing up bread pudding, murmuring her hopes for it, apologizing in advance
the way veteran cooks always do, when something in Beloved’s face, some petlike adoration that took
hold of her as she looked at Sethe, made Paul D speak.
“Ain’t you got no brothers or sisters?”
Beloved diddled her spoon but did not look at him. “I don’t have nobody.”
“What was you looking for when you came here?” he asked her.
“This place. I was looking for this place I could be in.”
“Somebody tell you about this house?”
“She told me. When I was at the bridge, she told me.”
“Must be somebody from the old days,” Sethe said. The days when 124 was a way station where
messages came and then their senders. Where bits of news soaked like dried beans in spring water—until
they were soft enough to digest.
“How’d you come? Who brought you?”
Now she looked steadily at him, but did not answer.
He could feel both Sethe and Denver pulling in, holding their stomach muscles, sending out sticky
spiderwebs to touch one another. He decided to force it anyway.
“I asked you who brought you here?”
“I walked here,” she said. “A long, long, long, long way. Nobody bring me. Nobody help me.”
“You had new shoes. If you walked so long why don’t your shoes show it?”
“Paul D, stop picking on her.”
“I want to know,” he said, holding the knife handle in his fist like a pole.
“I take the shoes! I take the dress! The shoe strings don’t fix!" she shouted and gave him a look so
malevolent Denver touched her arm.
“I’ll teach you,” said Denver, “how to tie your shoes,” and got a smile from Beloved as a reward.
Paul D had the feeling a large, silver fish had slipped from his hands the minute he grabbed hold of its
tail. That it was streaming back off into dark water now, gone but for the glistening marking its route. But
if her shining was not for him, who then? He had never known a woman who lit up for nobody in
particular, who just did it as a general announcement. Always, in his experience, the light appeared when
there was focus. Like the Thirty-Mile Woman, dulled to smoke while he waited with her in the ditch, and
starlight when Sixo got there. He never knew himself to mistake it. It was there the instant he looked at
Sethe’s wet legs, otherwise he never would have been bold enough to enclose her in his arms that day and
whisper into her back.
This girl Beloved, homeless and without people, beat all, though he couldn’t say exactly why,
considering the coloredpeople he had run into during the last twenty years. During, before and after the
War he had seen Negroes so stunned, or hungry, or tired or bereft it was a wonder they recalled or said
anything. Who, like him, had hidden in caves and fought owls for food; who, like him, stole from pigs;
who, like him, slept in trees in the day and walked by night; who, like him, had buried themselves in slop
and jumped in wells to avoid regulators, raiders, paterollers, veterans, hill men, posses and merrymakers.
Once he met a Negro about fourteen years old who lived by himself in the woods and said he couldn’t
remember living anywhere else. He saw a witless coloredwoman jailed and hanged for stealing ducks she
believed were her own babies.
Move. Walk. Run. Hide. Steal and move on. Only once had it been possible for him to stay in one
spot—with a woman, or a family—for longer than a few months. That once was almost two years with a
weaver lady in Delaware, the meanest place for Negroes he had ever seen outside Pulaski County,
Kentucky, and of course the prison camp in Georgia.
From all those Negroes, Beloved was different. Her shining, her new shoes. It bothered him. Maybe it
was just the fact that he didn’t bother her. Or it could be timing. She had appeared and been taken in on
the very day Sethe and he had patched up their quarrel, gone out in public and had a right good time—like
a family. Denver had come around, so to speak; Sethe was laughing; he had a promise of steady work, 124
was cleared up from spirits. It had begun to look like a life. And damn! a water-drinking woman fell sick,
got took in, healed, and hadn’t moved a peg since.
He wanted her out, but Sethe had let her in and he couldn’t put her out of a house that wasn’t his. It
was one thing to beat up a ghost, quite another to throw a helpless coloredgirl out in territory infected by
the Klan. Desperately thirsty for black blood, without which it could not live, the dragon swam the Ohio at
will.
Sitting at table, chewing on his after-supper broom straw, Paul D decided to place her. Consult with
the Negroes in town and find her her own place.
No sooner did he have the thought than Beloved strangled on one of the raisins she had picked out of
the bread pudding. She fell backward and off the chair and thrashed around holding her throat. Sethe
knocked her on the back while Denver pried her hands away from her neck. Beloved, on her hands and
knees, vomited up her food and struggled for breath.
When she was quiet and Denver had wiped up the mess, she said, “Go to sleep now.”
“Come in my room,” said Denver. “I can watch out for you up there.”
No moment could have been better. Denver had worried herself sick trying to think of a way to get
Beloved to share her room. It was hard sleeping above her, wondering if she was going to be sick again,
fall asleep and not wake, or (God, please don’t) get up and wander out of the yard just the way she
wandered in. They could have their talks easier there: at night when Sethe and Paul D were asleep; or in
the daytime before either came home. Sweet, crazy conversations full of half sentences, daydreams and
misunderstandings more thrilling than understanding could ever be.
When the girls left, Sethe began to clear the table. She stacked the plates near a basin of water.
“What is it about her vex you so?”
Paul D frowned, but said nothing.
“We had one good fight about Denver. Do we need one about her too?” asked Sethe.
“I just don’t understand what the hold is. It’s clear why she holds on to you, but I just can’t see why
you holding on to her.”
Sethe turned away from the plates toward him. “What you care who’s holding on to who? Feeding her
is no trouble. I pick up a little extra from the restaurant is all. And she’s nice girl company for Denver.
You know that and I know you know it, so what is it got your teeth on edge?”
“I can’t place it. It’s a feeling in me.”
“Well, feel this, why don’t you? Feel how it feels to have a bed to sleep in and somebody there not
worrying you to death about what you got to do each day to deserve it. Feel how that feels. And if that
don’t get it, feel how it feels to be a coloredwoman roaming the roads with anything God made liable to
jump on you. Feel that.”
“I know every bit of that, Sethe. I wasn’t born yesterday and I never mistreated a woman in my life.”
“That makes one in the world,” Sethe answered.
“Not two?”
“No. Not two.”
“What Halle ever do to you? Halle stood by you. He never left you.”
“What’d he leave then if not me?”
“I don’t know, but it wasn’t you. That’s a fact.”
“Then he did worse; he left his children.”
“You don’t know that.”
“He wasn’t there. He wasn’t where he said he would be.”
“He was there.”
“Then why didn’t he show himself? Why did I have to pack my babies off and stay behind to look for
him?”
“He couldn’t get out the loft.”
“Loft? What loft?”
“The one over your head. In the barn.”
Slowly, slowly, taking all the time allowed, Sethe moved toward the table.
“He saw?”
“He saw.”
“He told you?”
“You told me.”
“What?”
“The day I came in here. You said they stole your milk. I never knew what it was that messed him up.
That was it, I guess. All I knew was that something broke him. Not a one of them years of Saturdays,
Sundays and nighttime extra never touched him. But whatever he saw go on in that barn that day broke
him like a twig.”
“He saw?” Sethe was gripping her elbows as though to keep them from flying away.
“He saw. Must have.”
“He saw them boys do that to me and let them keep on breathing air? He saw? He saw? He saw?”
“Hey! Hey! Listen up. Let me tell you something. A man ain’t a goddamn ax. Chopping, hacking,
busting every goddamn minute of the day. Things get to him. Things he can’t chop down because they’re
inside.”
Sethe was pacing up and down, up and down in the lamplight. “The underground agent said, By
Sunday. They took my milk and he saw it and didn’t come down? Sunday came and he didn’t. Monday
came and no Halle. I thought he was dead, that’s why; then I thought they caught him, that’s why. Then I
thought, No, he’s not dead because if he was I’d know it, and then you come here after all this time and
you didn’t say he was dead, because you didn’t know either, so I thought, Well, he just found him another
better way to live. Because if he was anywhere near here, he’d come to Baby Suggs, if not to me. But I
never knew he saw ”
“What does that matter now?”
“If he is alive, and saw that, he won’t step foot in my door. Not Halle.”
“It broke him, Sethe.” Paul D looked up at her and sighed. “You may as well know it all. Last time I
saw him he was sitting by the churn. He had butter all over his face.”
Nothing happened, and she was grateful for that. Usually she could see the picture right away of what
she heard. But she could not picture what Paul D said. Nothing came to mind. Carefully, carefully, she
passed on to a reasonable question.
“What did he say?”
“Nothing.”
“Not a word?”
“Not a word.”
“Did you speak to him? Didn’t you say anything to him? Something!”
“I couldn’t, Sethe. I just…couldn’t.”
“Why!”
“I had a bit in my mouth.”
Sethe opened the front door and sat down on the porch steps. The day had gone blue without its sun,
but she could still make out the black silhouettes of trees in the meadow beyond. She shook her head from
side to side, resigned to her rebellious brain. Why was there nothing it refused? No misery, no regret, no
hateful picture too rotten to accept? Like a greedy child it snatched up everything. Just once, could it say,
No thank you? I just ate and can’t hold another bite? I am full God damn it of two boys with mossy teeth,
one sucking on my breast the other holding me down, their book-reading teacher watching and writing it
up. I am still full of that, God damn it, I can’t go back and add more. Add my husband to it, watching,
above me in the loft—hiding close by—the one place he thought no one would look for him, looking
down on what I couldn’t look at at all. And not stopping them—looking and letting it happen. But my
greedy brain says, Oh thanks, I’d love more—so I add more. And no sooner than I do, there is no
stopping. There is also my husband squatting by the churn smearing the butter as well as its clabber all
over his face because the milk they took is on his mind. And as far as he is concerned, the world may as
well know it. And if he was that broken then, then he is also and certainly dead now. And if Paul D saw
him and could not save or comfort him because the iron bit was in his mouth, then there is still more that
Paul D could tell me and my brain would go right ahead and take it and never say, No thank you. I don’t
want to know or have to remember that. I have other things to do: worry, for example, about tomorrow,
about Denver, about Beloved, about age and sickness not to speak of love.
But her brain was not interested in the future. Loaded with the past and hungry for more, it left her no
room to imagine, let alone plan for, the next day. Exactly like that afternoon in the wild onions—when one
more step was the most she could see of the future. Other people went crazy, why couldn’t she? Other
people’s brains stopped, turned around and went on to something new, which is what must have happened
to Halle. And how sweet that would have been: the two of them back by the milk shed, squatting by the
churn, smashing cold, lumpy butter into their faces with not a care in the world. Feeling it slippery,
sticky—rubbing it in their hair, watching it squeeze through their fingers. What a relief to stop it right
there. Close. Shut. Squeeze the butter. But her three children were chewing sugar teat under a blanket on
their way to Ohio and no butter play would change that.
Paul D stepped through the door and touched her shoulder.
“I didn’t plan on telling you that.”
“I didn’t plan on hearing it.”
“I can’t take it back, but I can leave it alone,” Paul D said.
He wants to tell me, she thought. He wants me to ask him about what it was like for him—about how
offended the tongue is, held down by iron, how the need to spit is so deep you cry for it. She already knew
about it, had seen it time after time in the place before Sweet Home. Men, boys, little girls, women. The
wildness that shot up into the eye the moment the lips were yanked back. Days after it was taken out,
goose fat was rubbed on the corners of the mouth but nothing to soothe the tongue or take the wildness out
of the eye.
Sethe looked up into Paul D’s eyes to see if there was any trace left in them.
“People I saw as a child,” she said, “who’d had the bit always looked wild after that. Whatever they
used it on them for, it couldn’t have worked, because it put a wildness where before there wasn’t any.
When I look at you, I don’t see it. There ain’t no wildness in your eye nowhere.”
“There’s a way to put it there and there’s a way to take it out. I know em both and I haven’t figured
out yet which is worse.” He sat down beside her. Sethe looked at him. In that unlit daylight his face,
bronzed and reduced to its bones, smoothed her heart down.
“You want to tell me about it?” she asked him.
“I don’t know. I never have talked about it. Not to a soul. Sang it sometimes, but I never told a soul.”
“Go ahead. I can hear it.”
“Maybe. Maybe you can hear it. I just ain’t sure I can say it. Say it right, I mean, because it wasn’t the
bit—that wasn’t it.”
“What then?” Sethe asked.
“The roosters,” he said. “Walking past the roosters looking at them look at me.”
Sethe smiled. “In that pine?”
“Yeah.” Paul D smiled with her. “Must have been five of them perched up there, and at least fifty
hens.”
“Mister, too?”
“Not right off. But I hadn’t took twenty steps before I seen him. He come down off the fence post
there and sat on the tub.”
“He loved that tub,” said Sethe, thinking, No, there is no stopping now.
“Didn’t he? Like a throne. Was me took him out the shell, you know. He’d a died if it hadn’t been for
me. The hen had walked on off with all the hatched peeps trailing behind her. There was this one egg left.
Looked like a blank, but then I saw it move so I tapped it open and here come Mister, bad feet and all. I
watched that son a bitch grow up and whup everything in the yard.”
“He always was hateful,” Sethe said.
“Yeah, he was hateful all right. Bloody too, and evil. Crooked feet flapping. Comb as big as my hand
and some kind of red. He sat right there on the tub looking at me. I swear he smiled. My head was full of
what I’d seen of Halle a while back. I wasn’t even thinking about the bit. Just Halle and before him Sixo,
but when I saw Mister I knew it was me too. Not just them, me too. One crazy, one sold, one missing, one
burnt and me licking iron with my hands crossed behind me. The last of the Sweet Home men.
“Mister, he looked so…free. Better than me. Stronger, tougher. Son a bitch couldn’t even get out the
shell by hisself but he was still king and I was…” Paul D stopped and squeezed his left hand with his
right. He held it that way long enough for it and the world to quiet down and let him go on.
“Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. But I wasn’t allowed to be and stay what I was. Even
if you cooked him you’d be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn’t no way I’d ever be Paul D again,
living or dead. Schoolteacher changed me. I was something else and that something was less than a
chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.”
Sethe put her hand on his knee and rubbed.
Paul D had only begun, what he was telling her was only the beginning when her fingers on his knee,
soft and reassuring, stopped him. Just as well. Just as well. Saying more might push them both to a place
they couldn’t get back from. He would keep the rest where it belonged: in that tobacco tin buried in his
chest where a red heart used to be. Its lid rusted shut. He would not pry it loose now in front of this sweet
sturdy woman, for if she got a whiff of the contents it would shame him. And it would hurt her to know
that there was no red heart bright as Mister’s comb beating in him.
Sethe rubbed and rubbed, pressing the work cloth and the stony curves that made up his knee. She
hoped it calmed him as it did her. Like kneading bread in the half-light of the restaurant kitchen. Before
the cook arrived when she stood in a space no wider than a bench is long, back behind and to the left of
the milk cans. Working dough. Working, working dough. Nothing better than that to start the day’s
serious work of beating back the past.
UPSTAIRS BELOVED was dancing. A little two-step, two-step, make-a-new-step, slide, slide and strut
on down.
Denver sat on the bed smiling and providing the music.
She had never seen Beloved this happy. She had seen her pouty lips open wide with the pleasure of
sugar or some piece of news Denver gave her. She had felt warm satisfaction radiating from Beloved’s
skin when she listened to her mother talk about the old days. But gaiety she had never seen. Not ten
minutes had passed since Beloved had fallen backward to the floor, pop-eyed, thrashing and holding her
throat. Now, after a few seconds lying in Denver’s bed, she was up and dancing.
“Where’d you learn to dance?” Denver asked her.
“Nowhere. Look at me do this.” Beloved put her fists on her hips and commenced to skip on bare feet.
Denver laughed.
“Now you. Come on,” said Beloved. “You may as well just come on.” Her black skirt swayed from
side to side.
Denver grew ice-cold as she rose from the bed. She knew she was twice Beloved’s size but she floated
up, cold and light as a snowflake.
Beloved took Denver’s hand and placed another on Denver’s shoulder. They danced then. Round and
round the tiny room and it may have been dizziness, or feeling light and icy at once, that made Denver
laugh so hard. A catching laugh that Beloved caught. The two of them, merry as kittens, swung to and fro,
to and fro, until exhausted they sat on the floor. Beloved let her head fall back on the edge of the bed
while she found her breath and Denver saw the tip of the thing she always saw in its entirety when
Beloved undressed to sleep. Looking straight at it she whispered, “Why you call yourself Beloved?”
Beloved closed her eyes. “In the dark my name is Beloved.”
Denver scooted a little closer. “What’s it like over there, where you were before? Can you tell me?”
“Dark,” said Beloved. “I’m small in that place. I’m like this here.” She raised her head off the bed, lay
down on her side and curled up.
Denver covered her lips with her fingers. “Were you cold?”
Beloved curled tighter and shook her head. “Hot. Nothing to breathe down there and no room to move
in.”
“You see anybody?”
“Heaps. A lot of people is down there. Some is dead.”
“You see Jesus? Baby Suggs?”
“I don’t know. I don’t know the names.” She sat up.
“Tell me, how did you get here?”
“I wait; then I got on the bridge. I stay there in the dark, in the daytime, in the dark, in the daytime. It
was a long time.”
“All this time you were on a bridge?”
“No. After. When I got out.”
“What did you come back for?”
Beloved smiled. “To see her face.”
“Ma’am’s? Sethe?”
“Yes, Sethe.”
Denver felt a little hurt, slighted that she was not the main reason for Beloved’s return. “Don’t you
remember we played together by the stream?”
“I was on the bridge,” said Beloved. “You see me on the bridge?”
“No, by the stream. The water back in the woods.”
“Oh, I was in the water. I saw her diamonds down there. I could touch them.”
“What stopped you?”
“She left me behind. By myself,” said Beloved. She lifted her eyes to meet Denver’s and frowned,
perhaps. Perhaps not. The tiny scratches on her forehead may have made it seem so.
Denver swallowed. “Don’t,” she said. “Don’t. You won’t leave us, will you?”
“No. Never. This is where I am.”
Suddenly Denver, who was sitting cross-legged, lurched forward and grabbed Beloved’s wrist. “Don’t
tell her. Don’t let Ma’am know who you are. Please, you hear?”
“Don’t tell me what to do. Don’t you never never tell me what to do.”
“But I’m on your side, Beloved.”
“She is the one. She is the one I need. You can go but she is the one I have to have.” Her eyes
stretched to the limit, black as the all-night sky.
“I didn’t do anything to you. I never hurt you. I never hurt anybody,” said Denver.
“Me either. Me either.”
“What you gonna do?”
“Stay here. I belong here.”
“I belong here too.”
“Then stay, but don’t never tell me what to do. Don’t never do that.”
“We were dancing. Just a minute ago we were dancing together. Let’s.”
“I don’t want to.” Beloved got up and lay down on the bed. Their quietness boomed about on the walls
like birds in panic. Finally Denver’s breath steadied against the threat of an unbearable loss.
“Tell me,” Beloved said. “Tell me how Sethe made you in the boat.”
“She never told me all of it,” said Denver.
“Tell me.”
Denver climbed up on the bed and folded her arms under her apron. She had not been in the tree room
once since Beloved sat on their stump after the carnival, and had not remembered that she hadn’t gone
there until this very desperate moment. Nothing was out there that this sister-girl did not provide in
abundance: a racing heart, dreaminess, society, danger, beauty. She swallowed twice to prepare for the
telling, to construct out of the strings she had heard all her life a net to hold Beloved.
“She had good hands, she said. The whitegirl, she said, had thin little arms but good hands. She saw
that right away, she said. Hair enough for five heads and good hands, she said. I guess the hands made her
think she could do it: get us both across the river. But the mouth was what kept her from being scared. She
said there ain’t nothing to go by with whitepeople. You don’t know how they’ll jump. Say one thing, do
another. But if you looked at the mouth sometimes you could tell by that. She said this girl talked a storm,
but there wasn’t no meanness around her mouth. She took Ma’am to that lean-to and rubbed her feet for
her, so that was one thing. And Ma’am believed she wasn’t going to turn her over. You could get money if
you turned a runaway over, and she wasn’t sure this girl Amy didn’t need money more than anything,
especially since all she talked about was getting hold of some velvet.”
“What’s velvet?”
“It’s a cloth, kind of deep and soft.”
“Go ahead.”
“Anyway, she rubbed Ma’am’s feet back to life, and she cried, she said, from how it hurt. But it made
her think she could make it on over to where Grandma Baby Suggs was and…”
“Who is that?”
“I just said it. My grandmother.”
“Is that Sethe’s mother?”
“No. My father’s mother.”
“Go ahead.”
“That’s where the others was. My brothers and…the baby girl. She sent them on before to wait for her
at Grandma Baby’s. So she had to put up with everything to get there. And this here girl Amy helped.”
Denver stopped and sighed. This was the part of the story she loved. She was coming to it now, and
she loved it because it was all about herself; but she hated it too because it made her feel like a bill was
owing somewhere and she, Denver, had to pay it. But who she owed or what to pay it with eluded her.
Now, watching Beloved’s alert and hungry face, how she took in every word, asking questions about the
color of things and their size, her downright craving to know, Denver began to see what she was saying
and not just to hear it: there is this nineteen-year-old slave girl—a year older than herself—walking
through the dark woods to get to her children who are far away. She is tired, scared maybe, and maybe
even lost. Most of all she is by herself and inside her is another baby she has to think about too. Behind
her dogs, perhaps; guns probably; and certainly mossy teeth. She is not so afraid at night because she is
the color of it, but in the day every sound is a shot or a tracker’s quiet step.
Denver was seeing it now and feeling it—through Beloved. Feeling how it must have felt to her
mother. Seeing how it must have looked. And the more fine points she made, the more detail she
provided, the more Beloved liked it. So she anticipated the questions by giving blood to the scraps her
mother and grandmother had told her—and a heartbeat. The monologue became, in fact, a duet as they lay
down together, Denver nursing Beloved’s interest like a lover whose pleasure was to overfeed the loved.
The dark quilt with two orange patches was there with them because Beloved wanted it near her when she
slept. It was smelling like grass and feeling like hands—the unrested hands of busy women: dry, warm,
prickly. Denver spoke, Beloved listened, and the two did the best they could to create what really
happened, how it really was, something only Sethe knew because she alone had the mind for it and the
time afterward to shape it: the quality of Amy’s voice, her breath like burning wood. The quick-change
weather up in those hills—cool at night, hot in the day, sudden fog. How recklessly she behaved with this
whitegirl—a recklessness born of desperation and encouraged by Amy’s fugitive eyes and her
tenderhearted mouth.
“You ain’t got no business walking round these hills, miss.”
“Looka here who’s talking. I got more business here ’n you got. They catch you they cut your head
off. Ain’t nobody after me but I know somebody after you.” Amy pressed her fingers into the soles of the
slavewoman’s feet. “Whose baby that?”
Sethe did not answer.
“You don’t even know. Come here, Jesus,” Amy sighed and shook her head. “Hurt?”
“A touch.”
“Good for you. More it hurt more better it is. Can’t nothing heal without pain, you know. What you
wiggling for?”
Sethe raised up on her elbows. Lying on her back so long had raised a ruckus between her shoulder
blades. The fire in her feet and the fire on her back made her sweat.
“My back hurt me,” she said.
“Your back? Gal, you a mess. Turn over here and let me see.”
In an effort so great it made her sick to her stomach, Sethe turned onto her right side. Amy unfastened
the back of her dress and said, “Come here, Jesus,” when she saw. Sethe guessed it must be bad because
after that call to Jesus Amy didn’t speak for a while. In the silence of an Amy struck dumb for a change,
Sethe felt the fingers of those good hands lightly touch her back. She could hear her breathing but still the
whitegirl said nothing. Sethe could not move. She couldn’t lie on her stomach or her back, and to keep on
her side meant pressure on her screaming feet. Amy spoke at last in her dreamwalker’s voice.
“It’s a tree, Lu. A chokecherry tree. See, here’s the trunk—it’s red and split wide open, full of sap, and
this here’s the parting for the branches. You got a mighty lot of branches. Leaves, too, look like, and dern
if these ain’t blossoms. Tiny little cherry blossoms, just as white. Your back got a whole tree on it. In
bloom. What God have in mind, I wonder. I had me some whippings, but I don’t remember nothing like
this. Mr. Buddy had a right evil hand too. Whip you for looking at him straight. Sure would. I looked right
at him one time and he hauled off and threw the poker at me. Guess he knew what I was a-thinking.”
Sethe groaned and Amy cut her reverie short—long enough to shift Sethe’s feet so the weight, resting
on leaf-covered stones, was above the ankles.
“That better? Lord what a way to die. You gonna die in here, you know. Ain’t no way out of it. Thank
your Maker I come along so’s you wouldn’t have to die outside in them weeds. Snake come along he bite
you. Bear eat you up. Maybe you should of stayed where you was, Lu. I can see by your back why you
didn’t ha ha. Whoever planted that tree beat Mr. Buddy by a mile. Glad I ain’t you. Well, spiderwebs is
’bout all I can do for you. What’s in here ain’t enough. I’ll look outside. Could use moss, but sometimes
bugs and things is in it. Maybe I ought to break them blossoms open. Get that pus to running, you think?
Wonder what God had in mind. You must of did something. Don’t run off nowhere now.”
Sethe could hear her humming away in the bushes as she hunted spiderwebs. A humming she
concentrated on because as soon as Amy ducked out the baby began to stretch. Good question, she was
thinking. What did He have in mind? Amy had left the back of Sethe’s dress open and now a tail of wind
hit it, taking the pain down a step. A relief that let her feel the lesser pain of her sore tongue. Amy returned
with two palmfuls of web, which she cleaned of prey and then draped on Sethe’s back, saying it was like
stringing a tree for Christmas.
“We got a old nigger girl come by our place. She don’t know nothing. Sews stuff for Mrs. Buddy—
real fine lace but can’t barely stick two words together. She don’t know no thing, just like you. You don’t
know a thing. End up dead, that’s what. Not me. I’m a get to Boston and get myself some velvet. Carmine.
You don’t even know about that, do you? Now you never will. Bet you never even sleep with the sun in
your face. I did it a couple of times. Most times I’m feeding stock before light and don’t get to sleep till
way after dark comes. But I was in the back of the wagon once and fell asleep. Sleeping with the sun in
your face is the best old feeling. Two times I did it. Once when I was little. Didn’t nobody bother me then.
Next time, in back of the wagon, it happened again and doggone if the chickens didn’t get loose. Mr.
Buddy whipped my tail. Kentucky ain’t no good place to be in. Boston’s the place to be in. That’s where
my mother was before she was give to Mr. Buddy. Joe Nathan said Mr. Buddy is my daddy but I don’t
believe that, you?”
Sethe told her she didn’t believe Mr. Buddy was her daddy.
“You know your daddy, do you?”
“No,” said Sethe.
“Neither me. All I know is it ain’t him.” She stood up then, having finished her repair work, and
weaving about the lean-to, her slow-moving eyes pale in the sun that lit her hair, she sang:
"When the busy day is done
And my weary little one
Rocketh gently to and fro;
When the night winds softly blow,
And the crickets in the glen
Chirp and chirp and chir- again;
Where ’pon the haunted green
Fairies dance around their queen.
Then from yonder misty skies
Cometh Lady Button Eyes.”
Suddenly she stopped weaving and rocking and sat down, her skinny arms wrapped around her knees,
her good good hands cupping her elbows. Her slow-moving eyes stopped and peered into the dirt at her
feet. “That’s my mama’s song. She taught me it.”
“Through the muck and mist and gloam
To our quiet cozy home,
Where to singing sweet and low
Rocks a cradle to and fro.
Where the clock ‘s dull monotone
Telleth of the day that’s done,
Where the moonbeams hover o’er
Playthings sleeping on the floor,
Where my weary wee one lies
Cometh Lady Button Eyes.
“Layeth she her hands upon
My dear weary little one,
And those white hands overspread
Like a veil the curly head,
Seem to fondle and caress
Every little silken tress.
Then she smooths the eyelids down
Over those two eyes of brown
In such soothing tender wise
Cometh Lady Button Eyes.”
Amy sat quietly after her song, then repeated the last line before she stood, left the lean-to and walked
off a little ways to lean against a young ash. When she came back the sun was in the valley below and they
were way above it in blue Kentucky light.
“You ain’t dead yet, Lu? Lu?”
“Not yet.”
“Make you a bet. You make it through the night, you make it all the way.” Amy rearranged the leaves
for comfort and knelt down to massage the swollen feet again. “Give these one more real good rub,” she
said, and when Sethe sucked air through her teeth, she said, “Shut up. You got to keep your mouth shut.”
Careful of her tongue, Sethe bit down on her lips and let the good hands go to work to the tune of “So
bees, sing soft and bees, sing low.” Afterward, Amy moved to the other side of the lean-to where, seated,
she lowered her head toward her shoulder and braided her hair, saying, “Don’t up and die on me in the
night, you hear? I don’t want to see your ugly black face hankering over me. If you do die, just go on off
somewhere where I can’t see you, hear?”
“I hear,” said Sethe. “I’ll do what I can, miss.”
Sethe never expected to see another thing in this world, so when she felt toes prodding her hip it took a
while to come out of a sleep she thought was death. She sat up, stiff and shivery, while Amy looked in on
her juicy back.
“Looks like the devil,” said Amy. “But you made it through. Come down here, Jesus, Lu made it
through. That’s because of me. I’m good at sick things. Can you walk, you think?”
“I have to let my water some kind of way.”
“Let’s see you walk on em.”
It was not good, but it was possible, so Sethe limped, holding on first to Amy, then to a sapling.
“Was me did it. I’m good at sick things ain’t I?”
“Yeah,” said Sethe, “you good.”
“We got to get off this here hill. Come on. I’ll take you down to the river. That ought to suit you. Me,
I’m going to the Pike. Take me straight to Boston. What’s that all over your dress?”
“Milk.”
“You one mess.”
Sethe looked down at her stomach and touched it. The baby was dead. She had not died in the night,
but the baby had. If that was the case, then there was no stopping now. She would get that milk to her
baby girl if she had to swim.
“Ain’t you hungry?” Amy asked her.
“I ain’t nothing but in a hurry, miss.”
“Whoa. Slow down. Want some shoes?”
“Say what?”
“I figured how,” said Amy and so she had. She tore two pieces from Sethe’s shawl, filled them with
leaves and tied them over her feet, chattering all the while.
“How old are you, Lu? I been bleeding for four years but I ain’t having nobody’s baby. Won’t catch
me sweating milk cause…”
“I know,” said Sethe. “You going to Boston.”
At noon they saw it; then they were near enough to hear it. By late afternoon they could drink from it
if they wanted to. Four stars were visible by the time they found, not a riverboat to stow Sethe away on, or
a ferryman willing to take on a fugitive passenger—nothing like that—but a whole boat to steal. It had one
oar, lots of holes and two bird nests.
“There you go, Lu. Jesus looking at you.”
Sethe was looking at one mile of dark water, which would have to be split with one oar in a useless
boat against a current dedicated to the Mississippi hundreds of miles away. It looked like home to her, and
the baby (not dead in the least) must have thought so too. As soon as Sethe got close to the river her own
water broke loose to join it. The break, followed by the redundant announcement of labor, arched her
back.
“What you doing that for?” asked Amy. “Ain’t you got a brain in your head? Stop that right now. I
said stop it, Lu. You the dumbest thing on this here earth. Lu! Lu!”
Sethe couldn’t think of anywhere to go but in. She waited for the sweet beat that followed the blast of
pain. On her knees again, she crawled into the boat. It waddled under her and she had just enough time to
brace her leaf-bag feet on the bench when another rip took her breath away. Panting under four summer
stars, she threw her legs over the sides, because here come the head, as Amy informed her as though she
did not know it—as though the rip was a breakup of walnut logs in the brace, or of lightning’s jagged tear
through a leather sky.
It was stuck. Face up and drowning in its mother’s blood. Amy stopped begging Jesus and began to
curse His daddy.
“Push!” screamed Amy.
“Pull,” whispered Sethe.
And the strong hands went to work a fourth time, none too soon, for river water, seeping through any
hole it chose, was spreading over Sethe’s hips. She reached one arm back and grabbed the rope while
Amy fairly clawed at the head. When a foot rose from the river bed and kicked the bottom of the boat and
Sethe’s behind, she knew it was done and permitted herself a short faint. Coming to, she heard no cries,
just Amy’s encouraging coos. Nothing happened for so long they both believed they had lost it. Sethe
arched suddenly and the afterbirth shot out. Then the baby whimpered and Sethe looked. Twenty inches of
cord hung from its belly and it trembled in the cooling evening air. Amy wrapped her skirt around it and
the wet sticky women clambered ashore to see what, indeed, God had in mind.
Spores of bluefern growing in the hollows along the riverbank float toward the water in silver-blue
lines hard to see unless you are in or near them, lying right at the river’s edge when the sunshots are low
and drained. Often they are mistook for insects—but they are seeds in which the whole generation sleeps
confident of a future. And for a moment it is easy to believe each one has one—will become all of what is
contained in the spore: will live out its days as planned. This moment of certainty lasts no longer than that;
longer, perhaps, than the spore itself.
On a riverbank in the cool of a summer evening two women struggled under a shower of silvery blue.
They never expected to see each other again in this world and at the moment couldn’t care less. But there
on a summer night surrounded by bluefern they did something together appropriately and well. A
pateroller passing would have sniggered to see two throw-away people, two lawless outlaws—a slave and
a barefoot whitewoman with unpinned hair—wrapping a ten-minute-old baby in the rags they wore. But
no pateroller came and no preacher. The water sucked and swallowed itself beneath them. There was
nothing to disturb them at their work. So they did it appropriately and well.
Twilight came on and Amy said she had to go; that she wouldn’t be caught dead in dayIight on a busy
river with a runaway. After rinsing her hands and face in the river, she stood and looked down at the baby
wrapped and tied to Sethe’s chest.
“She’s never gonna know who I am. You gonna tell her? Who brought her into this here world?” She
lifted her chin, looked off into the place where the sun used to be. “You better tell her. You hear? Say
Miss Amy Denver. Of Boston.”
Sethe felt herself falling into a sleep she knew would be deep. On the lip of it, just before going under,
she thought, “That’s pretty. Denver. Real pretty.”
IT WAS TIME to lay it all down. Before Paul D came and sat on her porch steps, words whispered in the
keeping room had kept her going. Helped her endure the chastising ghost; refurbished the baby faces of
Howard and Buglar and kept them whole in the world because in her dreams she saw only their parts in
trees; and kept her husband shadowy but there—somewhere. Now Halle’s face between the butter press
and the churn swelled larger and larger, crowding her eyes and making her head hurt. She wished for
Baby Suggs, fingers molding her nape, reshaping it, saying, “Lay em down, Sethe. Sword and shield.
Down. Down. Both of em down. Down by the riverside. Sword and shield. Don’t study war no more. Lay
all that mess down. Sword and shield.” And under the pressing fingers and the quiet instructive voice, she
would. Her heavy knives of defense against misery, regret, gall and hurt, she placed one by one on a bank
where clear water rushed on below.
Nine years without the fingers or the voice of Baby Suggs was too much. And words whispered in the
keeping room were too little. The butter-smeared face of a man God made none sweeter than demanded
more: an arch built or a robe sewn. Some fixing ceremony. Sethe decided to go to the Clearing, back
where Baby Suggs had danced in sunlight.
Before 124 and everybody in it had closed down, veiled over and shut away; before it had become the
plaything of spirits and the home of the chafed, 124 had been a cheerful, buzzing house where Baby
Suggs, holy, loved, cautioned, fed, chastised and soothed. Where not one but two pots simmered on the
stove; where the lamp burned all night long. Strangers rested there while children tried on their shoes.
Messages were left there for whoever needed them was sure to stop in one day soon. Talk was low and to
the point—for Baby Suggs, holy, didn’t approve of extra. “Everything depends on knowing how much,”
she said, and “Good is knowing when to stop.”
It was in front of that 124 that Sethe climbed off a wagon, her newborn tied to her chest, and felt for
the first time the wide arms of her mother-in-law, who had made it to Cincinnati. Who decided that,
because slave life had “busted her legs, back, head, eyes, hands, kidneys, womb and tongue,” she had
nothing left to make a living with but her heart—which she put to work at once. Accepting no title of
honor before her name, but allowing a small caress after it, she became an unchurched preacher, one who
visited pulpits and opened her great heart to those who could use it. In winter and fall she carried it to
AME’s and Baptists, Holinesses and Sanctifieds, the Church of the Redeemer and the Redeemed.
Uncalled, unrobed, unanointed, she let her great heart beat in their presence. When warm weather came,
Baby Suggs, holy, followed by every black man, woman and child who could make it through, took her
great heart to the Clearing—a wide-open place cut deep in the woods nobody knew for what at the end of
a path known only to deer and whoever cleared the land in the first place. In the heat of every Saturday
afternoon, she sat in the clearing while the people waited among the trees.
After situating herself on a huge flat-sided rock, Baby Suggs bowed her head and prayed silently. The
company watched her from the trees. They knew she was ready when she put her stick down. Then she
shouted, “Let the children come!” and they ran from the trees toward her.
“Let your mothers hear you laugh,” she told them, and the woods rang. The adults looked on and
could not help smiling.
Then “Let the grown men come,” she shouted. They stepped out one by one from among the ringing
trees.
“Let your wives and your children see you dance,” she told them, and groundlife shuddered under
their feet.
Finally she called the women to her. “Cry,” she told them. “For the living and the dead. Just cry.” And
without covering their eyes the women let loose.
It started that way: laughing children, dancing men, crying women and then it got mixed up. Women
stopped crying and danced; men sat down and cried; children danced, women laughed, children cried
until, exhausted and riven, all and each lay about the Clearing damp and gasping for breath. In the silence
that followed, Baby Suggs, holy, offered up to them her great big heart.
She did not tell them to clean up their lives or to go and sin no more. She did not tell them they were
the blessed of the earth, its inheriting meek or its glorybound pure.
She told them that the only grace they could have was the grace they could imagine. That if they could
not see it, they would not have it.
“Here,” she said, “in this here place, we flesh; flesh that weeps, laughs; flesh that dances on bare feet
in grass. Love it. Love it hard. Yonder they do not love your flesh. They despise it. They don’t love your
eyes; they’d just as soon pick em out. No more do they love the skin on your back. Yonder they flay it.
And O my people they do not love your hands. Those they only use, tie, bind, chop off and leave empty.
Love your hands! Love them. Raise them up and kiss them. Touch others with them, pat them together,
stroke them on your face ’cause they don’t love that either. You got to love it, you! And no, they ain’t in
love with your mouth. Yonder, out there, they will see it broken and break it again. What you say out of it
they will not heed. What you scream from it they do not hear. What you put into it to nourish your body
they will snatch away and give you leavins instead. No, they don’t love your mouth. You got to love it.
This is flesh I’m talking about here. Flesh that needs to be loved. Feet that need to rest and to dance; backs
that need support; shoulders that need arms, strong arms I’m telling you. And O my people, out yonder,
hear me, they do not love your neck unnoosed and straight. So love your neck; put a hand on it, grace it,
stroke it and hold it up. And all your inside parts that they’d just as soon slop for hogs, you got to love
them. The dark, dark liver—love it, love it, and the beat and beating heart, love that too. More than eyes or
feet. More than lungs that have yet to draw free air. More than your life-holding womb and your lifegiving private parts, hear me now, love your heart. For this is the prize.” Saying no more, she stood up
then and danced with her twisted hip the rest of what her heart had to say while the others opened their
mouths and gave her the music. Long notes held until the four-part harmony was perfect enough for their
deeply loved flesh.
Sethe wanted to be there now. At the least to listen to the spaces that the long-ago singing had left
behind. At the most to get a clue from her husband’s dead mother as to what she should do with her sword
and shield now, dear Jesus, now nine years after Baby Suggs, holy, proved herself a liar, dismissed her
great heart and lay in the keeping-room bed roused once in a while by a craving for color and not for
another thing.
“Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed,” she said, “and broke my heartstrings too. There
is no bad luck in the world but whitefolks.” 124 shut down and put up with the venom of its ghost. No
more lamp all night long, or neighbors dropping by. No low conversations after supper. No watched
barefoot children playing in the shoes of strangers. Baby Suggs, holy, believed she had lied. There was no
grace—imaginary or real—and no sunlit dance in a Clearing could change that. Her faith, her love, her
imagination and her great big old heart began to collapse twenty-eight days after her daughter-in-law
arrived.
Yet it was to the Clearing that Sethe determined to go—to pay tribute to Halle. Before the light
changed, while it was still the green blessed place she remembered: misty with plant steam and the decay
of berries.
She put on a shawl and told Denver and Beloved to do likewise. All three set out late one Sunday
morning, Sethe leading, the girls trotting behind, not a soul in sight.
When they reached the woods it took her no time to find the path through it because big-city revivals
were held there regularly now, complete with food-laden tables, banjos and a tent. The old path was a
track now, but still arched over with trees dropping buckeyes onto the grass below.
There was nothing to be done other than what she had done, but Sethe blamed herself for Baby Suggs’
collapse. However many times Baby denied it, Sethe knew the grief at 124 started when she jumped down
off the wagon, her newborn tied to her chest in the underwear of a whitegirl looking for Boston.
Followed by the two girls, down a bright green corridor of oak and horse chestnut, Sethe began to
sweat a sweat just like the other one when she woke, mud-caked, on the banks of the Ohio.
Amy was gone. Sethe was alone and weak, but alive, and so was her baby. She walked a ways
downriver and then stood gazing at the glimmering water. By and by a flatbed slid into view, but she
could not see if the figures on it were whitepeople or not. She began to sweat from a fever she thanked
God for since it would certainly keep her baby warm. When the flatbed was beyond her sight she stumbled
on and found herself near three coloredpeople fishing—two boys and an older man. She stopped and
waited to be spoken to. One of the boys pointed and the man looked over his shoulder at her—a quick
look since all he needed to know about her he could see in no time.
No one said anything for a while. Then the man said, “Headin’ ’cross?”
“Yes, sir,” said Sethe.
“Anybody know you coming?”
“Yes, sir.”
He looked at her again and nodded toward a rock that stuck out of the ground above him like a bottom
lip. Sethe walked to it and sat down. The stone had eaten the sun’s rays but was nowhere near as hot as
she was. Too tired to move, she stayed there, the sun in her eyes making her dizzy. Sweat poured over her
and bathed the baby completely. She must have slept sitting up, because when next she opened her eyes
the man was standing in front of her with a smoking-hot piece of fried eel in his hands. It was an effort to
reach for, more to smell, impossible to eat. She begged him for water and he gave her some of the Ohio in
a jar. Sethe drank it all and begged more. The clanging was back in her head but she refused to believe
that she had come all that way, endured all she had, to die on the wrong side of the river.
The man watched her streaming face and called one of the boys over.
“Take off that coat,” he told him.
“Sir?”
“You heard me.”
The boy slipped out of his jacket, whining, “What you gonna do? What I’m gonna wear?”
The man untied the baby from her chest and wrapped it in the boy’s coat, knotting the sleeves in front.
“What I’m gonna wear?”
The old man sighed and, after a pause, said, “You want it back, then go head and take it off that baby.
Put the baby naked in the grass and put your coat back on. And if you can do it, then go on ’way
somewhere and don’t come back.”
The boy dropped his eyes, then turned to join the other. With eel in her hand, the baby at her feet,
Sethe dozed, dry-mouthed and sweaty. Evening came and the man touched her shoulder.
Contrary to what she expected they poled upriver, far away from the rowboat Amy had found. Just
when she thought he was taking her back to Kentucky, he turned the flatbed and crossed the Ohio like a
shot. There he helped her up the steep bank, while the boy without a jacket carried the baby who wore it.
The man led her to a brush-covered hutch with a beaten floor.
“Wait here. Somebody be here directly. Don’t move. They’ll find you.”
“Thank you,” she said. “I wish I knew your name so I could remember you right.”
“Name’s Stamp,” he said. “Stamp Paid. Watch out for that there baby, you hear?”
“I hear. I hear,” she said, but she didn’t. Hours later a woman was right up on her before she heard a
thing. A short woman, young, with a croaker sack, greeted her.
“Saw the sign a while ago,” she said. “But I couldn’t get here no quicker.”
“What sign?” asked Sethe.
“Stamp leaves the old sty open when there’s a crossing. Knots a white rag on the post if it’s a child
too.”
She knelt and emptied the sack. “My name’s Ella,” she said, taking a wool blanket, cotton cloth, two
baked sweet potatoes and a pair of men’s shoes from the sack. “My husband, John, is out yonder a ways.
Where you heading?”
Sethe told her about Baby Suggs where she had sent her three children.
Ella wrapped a cloth strip tight around the baby’s navel as she listened for the holes—the things the
fugitives did not say; the questions they did not ask. Listened too for the unnamed, unmentioned people
left behind. She shook gravel from the men’s shoes and tried to force Sethe’s feet into them. They would
not go. Sadly, they split them down the heel, sorry indeed to ruin so valuable an item. Sethe put on the
boy’s jacket, not daring to ask whether there was any word of the children.
“They made it,” said Ella. “Stamp ferried some of that party. Left them on Bluestone. It ain’t too far.”
Sethe couldn’t think of anything to do, so grateful was she, so she peeled a potato, ate it, spit it up and
ate more in quiet celebration.
“They be glad to see you,” said Ella. “When was this one born?”
“Yesterday,” said Sethe, wiping sweat from under her chin. “I hope she makes it.”
Ella looked at the tiny, dirty face poking out of the wool blanket and shook her head. “Hard to say,”
she said. “If anybody was to ask me I’d say, ‘Don’t love nothing.’ ” Then, as if to take the edge off her
pronouncement, she smiled at Sethe. “You had that baby by yourself?”
“No. Whitegirl helped.”
“Then we better make tracks.”
Baby Suggs kissed her on the mouth and refused to let her see the children. They were asleep she said
and Sethe was too ugly-looking to wake them in the night. She took the newborn and handed it to a young
woman in a bonnet, telling her not to clean the eyes till she got the mother’s urine.
“Has it cried out yet?” asked Baby.
“A little.”
“Time enough. Let’s get the mother well.”
She led Sethe to the keeping room and, by the light of a spirit lamp, bathed her in sections, starting
with her face. Then, while waiting for another pan of heated water, she sat next to her and stitched gray
cotton. Sethe dozed and woke to the washing of her hands and arms. After each bathing, Baby covered her
with a quilt and put another pan on in the kitchen. Tearing sheets, stitching the gray cotton, she supervised
the woman in the bonnet who tended the baby and cried into her cooking. When Sethe’s legs were done,
Baby looked at her feet and wiped them lightly. She cleaned between Sethe’s legs with two separate pans
of hot water and then tied her stomach and vagina with sheets. Finally she attacked the unrecognizable
feet.
“You feel this?”
“Feel what?” asked Sethe.
“Nothing. Heave up.” She helped Sethe to a rocker and lowered her feet into a bucket of salt water and
juniper. The rest of the night Sethe sat soaking. The crust from her nipples Baby softened with lard and
then washed away. By dawn the silent baby woke and took her mother’s milk.
“Pray God it ain’t turned bad,” said Baby. “And when you through, call me.” As she turned to go,
Baby Suggs caught a glimpse of something dark on the bed sheet. She frowned and looked at her
daughter-in-law bending toward the baby. Roses of blood blossomed in the blanket covering Sethe’s
shoulders. Baby Suggs hid her mouth with her hand. When the nursing was over and the newborn was
asleep—its eyes half open, its tongue dream-sucking—wordlessly the older woman greased the flowering
back and pinned a double thickness of cloth to the inside of the newly stitched dress.
It was not real yet. Not yet. But when her sleepy boys and crawling-already? girl were brought in, it
didn’t matter whether it was real or not. Sethe lay in bed under, around, over, among but especially with
them all. The little girl dribbled clear spit into her face, and Sethe’s laugh of delight was so loud the
crawling-already? baby blinked. Buglar and Howard played with her ugly feet, after daring each other to
be the first to touch them. She kept kissing them. She kissed the backs of their necks, the tops of their
heads and the centers of their palms, and it was the boys who decided enough was enough when she lifted
their shirts to kiss their tight round bellies. She stopped when and because they said, “Pappie come?”
She didn’t cry. She said “soon” and smiled so they would think the brightness in her eyes was love
alone. It was some time before she let Baby Suggs shoo the boys away so Sethe could put on the gray
cotton dress her mother-in-law had started stitching together the night before. Finally she lay back and
cradled the crawling-already? girl in her arms. She enclosed her left nipple with two fingers of her right
hand and the child opened her mouth. They hit home together.
Baby Suggs came in and laughed at them, telling Sethe how strong the baby girl was, how smart,
already crawling. Then she stooped to gather up the ball of rags that had been Sethe’s clothes.
“Nothing worth saving in here,” she said.
Sethe lifted her eyes. “Wait,” she called. “Look and see if there’s something still knotted up in the
petticoat.”
Baby Suggs inched the spoiled fabric through her fingers and came upon what felt like pebbles. She
held them out toward Sethe. “Going-away present?”
“Wedding present.”
“Be nice if there was a groom to go with it.” She gazed into her hand. “What you think happened to
him?”
“I don’t know,” said Sethe. “He wasn’t where he said to meet him at. I had to get out. Had to.” Sethe
watched the drowsy eyes of the sucking girl for a moment then looked at Baby Suggs’ face. “He’ll make
it. If I made it, Halle sure can.”
“Well, put these on. Maybe they’ll light his way.” Convinced her son was dead, she handed the stones
to Sethe.
“I need holes in my ears.”
“I’ll do it,” said Baby Suggs. “Soon’s you up to it.”
Sethe jingled the earrings for the pleasure of the crawling-already? girl, who reached for them over
and over again.
In the Clearing, Sethe found Baby’s old preaching rock and remembered the smell of leaves
simmering in the sun, thunderous feet and the shouts that ripped pods off the limbs of the chestnuts. With
Baby Suggs’ heart in charge, the people let go.
Sethe had had twenty-eight days—the travel of one whole moon—of unslaved life. From the pure
clear stream of spit that the little girl dribbled into her face to her oily blood was twenty-eight days. Days
of healing, ease and real-talk. Days of company: knowing the names of forty, fifty other Negroes, their
views, habits; where they had been and what done; of feeling their fun and sorrow along with her own,
which made it better. One taught her the alphabet; another a stitch. All taught her how it felt to wake up at
dawn and decide what to do with the day. That’s how she got through the waiting for Halle. Bit by bit, at
124 and in the Clearing, along with the others, she had claimed herself. Freeing yourself was one thing;
claiming ownership of that freed self was another.
Now she sat on Baby Suggs’ rock, Denver and Beloved watching her from the trees. There will never
be a day, she thought, when Halle will knock on the door. Not knowing it was hard; knowing it was
harder.
Just the fingers, she thought. Just let me feel your fingers again on the back of my neck and I will lay
it all down, make a way out of this no way. Sethe bowed her head and sure enough—they were there.
Lighter now, no more than the strokes of bird feather, but unmistakably caressing fingers. She had to relax
a bit to let them do their work, so light was the touch, childlike almost, more finger kiss than kneading.
Still she was grateful for the effort; Baby Suggs’ long-distance love was equal to any skin-close love she
had known. The desire, let alone the gesture, to meet her needs was good enough to lift her spirits to the
place where she could take the next step: ask for some clarifying word; some advice about how to keep on
with a brain greedy for news nobody could live with in a world happy to provide it.
She knew Paul D was adding something to her life—something she wanted to count on but was scared
to. Now he had added more: new pictures and old rememories that broke her heart. Into the empty space
of not knowing about Halle—a space sometimes colored with righteous resentment at what could have
been his cowardice, or stupidity or bad luck—that empty place of no definite news was filled now with a
brand-new sorrow and who could tell how many more on the way. Years ago—when 124 was alive—she
had women friends, men friends from all around to share grief with. Then there was no one, for they
would not visit her while the baby ghost filled the house, and she returned their disapproval with the
potent pride of the mistreated. But now there was someone to share it, and he had beat the spirit away the
very day he entered her house and no sign of it since. A blessing, but in its place he brought another kind
of haunting: Halle’s face smeared with butter and the clabber too; his own mouth jammed full of iron, and
Lord knows what else he could tell her if he wanted to.
The fingers touching the back of her neck were stronger now—the strokes bolder as though Baby
Suggs were gathering strength. Putting the thumbs at the nape, while the fingers pressed the sides. Harder,
harder, the fingers moved slowly around toward her windpipe, making little circles on the way. Sethe was
actually more surprised than frightened to find that she was being strangled. Or so it seemed. In any case,
Baby Suggs’ fingers had a grip on her that would not let her breathe. Tumbling forward from her seat on
the rock, she clawed at the hands that were not there. Her feet were thrashing by the time Denver got to
her and then Beloved.
“Ma’am! Ma’am!” Denver shouted. “Ma’ammy!” and turned her mother over on her back.
The fingers left off and Sethe had to swallow huge draughts of air before she recognized her
daughter’s face next to her own and Beloved’s hovering above.
“You all right?”
“Somebody choked me,” said Sethe.
“Who?”
Sethe rubbed her neck and struggled to a sitting position. “Grandma Baby, I reckon. I just asked her to
rub my neck, like she used to and she was doing fine and then just got crazy with it, I guess.”
“She wouldn’t do that to you, Ma’am. Grandma Baby? Uh uh.”
“Help me up from here.”
“Look.” Beloved was pointing at Sethe’s neck.
“What is it? What you see?” asked Sethe.
“Bruises,” said Denver.
“On my neck?”
“Here,” said Beloved. “Here and here, too.” She reached out her hand and touched the splotches,
gathering color darker than Sethe’s dark throat, and her fingers were mighty cool.
“That don’t help nothing,” Denver said, but Beloved was leaning in, her two hands stroking the damp
skin that felt like chamois and looked like taffeta.
Sethe moaned. The girl’s fingers were so cool and knowing. Sethe’s knotted, private, walk-on-water
life gave in a bit, softened, and it seemed that the glimpse of happiness she caught in the shadows
swinging hands on the road to the carnival was a likelihood—if she could just manage the news Paul D
brought and the news he kept to himself. Just manage it. Not break, fall or cry each time a hateful picture
drifted in front of her face. Not develop some permanent craziness like Baby Suggs’ friend, a young
woman in a bonnet whose food was full of tears. Like Aunt Phyllis, who slept with her eyes wide open.
Like Jackson Till, who slept under the bed. All she wanted was to go on. As she had. Alone with her
daughter in a haunted house she managed every damn thing. Why now, with Paul D instead of the ghost,
was she breaking up? getting scared? needing Baby? The worst was over, wasn’t it? She had already got
through, hadn’t she? With the ghost in 124 she could bear, do, solve anything. Now a hint of what had
happened to Halle and she cut out like a rabbit looking for its mother.
Beloved’s fingers were heavenly. Under them and breathing evenly again, the anguish rolled down.
The peace Sethe had come there to find crept into her.
We must look a sight, she thought, and closed her eyes to see it: the three women in the middle of the
Clearing, at the base of the rock where Baby Suggs, holy, had loved. One seated, yielding up her throat to
the kind hands of one of the two kneeling before her.
Denver watched the faces of the other two. Beloved watched the work her thumbs were doing and
must have loved what she saw because she leaned over and kissed the tenderness under Sethe’s chin.
They stayed that way for a while because neither Denver nor Sethe knew how not to: how to stop and
not love the look or feel of the lips that kept on kissing. Then Sethe, grabbing Beloved’s hair and blinking
rapidly, separated herself. She later believed that it was because the girl’s breath was exactly like new
milk that she said to her, stern and frowning, “You too old for that.”
She looked at Denver, and seeing panic about to become something more, stood up quickly, breaking
the tableau apart.
“Come on up! Up!” Sethe waved the girls to their feet. As they left the Clearing they looked pretty
much the same as they had when they had come: Sethe in the lead, the girls a ways back. All silent as
before, but with a difference. Sethe was bothered, not because of the kiss, but because, just before it, when
she was feeling so fine letting Beloved massage away the pain, the fingers she was loving and the ones
that had soothed her before they strangled her had reminded her of something that now slipped her mind.
But one thing for sure, Baby Suggs had not choked her as first she thought. Denver was right, and walking
in the dappled tree-light, clearer-headed now—away from the enchantment of the Clearing—Sethe
remembered the touch of those fingers that she knew better than her own. They had bathed her in sections,
wrapped her womb, combed her hair, oiled her nipples, stitched her clothes, cleaned her feet, greased her
back and dropped just about anything they were doing to massage Sethe’s nape when, especially in the
early days, her spirits fell down under the weight of the things she remembered and those she did not:
schoolteacher writing in ink she herself had made while his nephews played on her; the face of the woman
in a felt hat as she rose to stretch in the field. If she lay among all the hands in the world, she would know
Baby Suggs’ just as she did the good hands of the whitegirl looking for velvet. But for eighteen years she
had lived in a house full of touches from the other side. And the thumbs that pressed her nape were the
same. Maybe that was where it had gone to. After Paul D beat it out of 124, maybe it collected itself in the
Clearing. Reasonable, she thought.
Why she had taken Denver and Beloved with her didn’t puzzle her now—at the time it seemed
impulse, with a vague wish for protection. And the girls had saved her, Beloved so agitated she behaved
like a two-year-old.
Like a faint smell of burning that disappears when the fire is cut off or the window opened for a
breeze, the suspicion that the girl’s touch was also exactly like the baby’s ghost dissipated. It was only a
tiny disturbance anyway—not strong enough to divert her from the ambition welling in her now: she
wanted Paul D. No matter what he told and knew, she wanted him in her life. More than commemorating
Halle, that is what she had come to the Clearing to figure out, and now it was figured. Trust and
rememory, yes, the way she believed it could be when he cradled her before the cooking stove. The weight
and angle of him; the true-to-life beard hair on him; arched back, educated hands. His waiting eyes and
awful human power. The mind of him that knew her own. Her story was bearable because it was his as
well—to tell, to refine and tell again. The things neither knew about the other—the things neither had
word-shapes for—well, it would come in time: where they led him off to sucking iron; the perfect death of
her crawling-already? baby.
She wanted to get back—fast. Set these idle girls to some work that would fill their wandering heads.
Rushing through the green corridor, cooler now because the sun had moved, it occurred to her that the two
were alike as sisters. Their obedience and absolute reliability shot through with surprise. Sethe understood
Denver. Solitude had made her secretive—self-manipulated. Years of haunting had dulled her in ways you
wouldn’t believe and sharpened her in ways you wouldn’t believe either. The consequence was a timid but
hard-headed daughter Sethe would die to protect. The other, Beloved, she knew less, nothing, about—
except that there was nothing she wouldn’t do for Sethe and that Denver and she liked each other’s
company. Now she thought she knew why. They spent up or held on to their feelings in harmonious ways.
What one had to give the other was pleased to take. They hung back in the trees that ringed the Clearing,
then rushed into it with screams and kisses when Sethe choked—anyhow that’s how she explained it to
herself for she noticed neither competition between the two nor domination by one. On her mind was the
supper she wanted to fix for Paul D—something difficult to do, something she would do just so—to
launch her newer, stronger life with a tender man. Those litty bitty potatoes browned on all sides, heavy
on the pepper; snap beans seasoned with rind; yellow squash sprinkled with vinegar and sugar. Maybe
corn cut from the cob and fried with green onions and butter. Raised bread, even.
Her mind, searching the kitchen before she got to it, was so full of her offering she did not see right
away, in the space under the white stairs, the wooden tub and Paul D sitting in it. She smiled at him and he
smiled back.
“Summer must be over,” she said.
“Come on in here.”
“Uh uh. Girls right behind me.”
“I don’t hear nobody.”
“I have to cook, Paul D.”
“Me too.” He stood up and made her stay there while he held her in his arms. Her dress soaked up the
water from his body. His jaw was near her ear. Her chin touched his shoulder.
“What you gonna cook?”
“I thought some snap beans.”
“Oh, yeah.”
‘Fry up a little corn?”
“Yeah.”
There was no question but that she could do it. Just like the day she arrived at 124—sure enough, she
had milk enough for all.
Beloved came through the door and they ought to have heard her tread, but they didn’t.
Breathing and murmuring, breathing and murmuring. Beloved heard them as soon as the door banged
shut behind her. She jumped at the slam and swiveled her head toward the whispers coming from behind
the white stairs. She took a step and felt like crying. She had been so close, then closer. And it was so
much better than the anger that ruled when Sethe did or thought anything that excluded herself. She could
bear the hours—nine or ten of them each day but one—when Sethe was gone. Bear even the nights when
she was close but out of sight, behind walls and doors lying next to him. But now—even the daylight time
that Beloved had counted on, disciplined herself to be content with, was being reduced, divided by Sethe’s
willingness to pay attention to other things. Him mostly. Him who said something to her that made her run
out into the woods and talk to herself on a rock. Him who kept her hidden at night behind doors. And him
who had hold of her now whispering behind the stairs after Beloved had rescued her neck and was ready
now to put her hand in that woman’s own.
Beloved turned around and left. Denver had not arrived, or else she was waiting somewhere outside.
Beloved went to look, pausing to watch a cardinal hop from limb to branch. She followed the blood spot
shifting in the leaves until she lost it and even then she walked on, backward, still hungry for another
glimpse.
She turned finally and ran through the woods to the stream. Standing close to its edge she watched her
reflection there. When Denver’s face joined hers, they stared at each other in the water.
“You did it, I saw you,” said Denver.
“What?”
“I saw your face. You made her choke.”
“I didn’t do it.”
“You told me you loved her.”
“I fixed it, didn’t I? Didn’t I fix her neck?”
“After. After you choked her neck.”
“I kissed her neck. I didn’t choke it. The circle of iron choked it.”
“I saw you.” Denver grabbed Beloved’s arm.
“Look out, girl,” said Beloved and, snatching her arm away, ran ahead as fast as she could along the
stream that sang on the other side of the woods.
Left alone, Denver wondered if, indeed, she had been wrong. She and Beloved were standing in the
trees whispering, while Sethe sat on the rock. Denver knew that the Clearing used to be where Baby Suggs
preached, but that was when she was a baby. She had never been there herself to remember it. 124 and the
field behind it were all the world she knew or wanted.
Once upon a time she had known more and wanted to. Had walked the path leading to a real other
house. Had stood outside the window listening. Four times she did it on her own—crept away from 124
early in the afternoon when her mother and grandmother had their guard down, just before supper, after
chores; the blank hour before gears changed to evening occupations. Denver had walked off looking for
the house other children visited but not her. When she found it she was too timid to go to the front door so
she peeped in the window. Lady Jones sat in a straight-backed chair; several children sat cross-legged on
the floor in front of her. Lady Jones had a book. The children had slates. Lady Jones was saying
something too soft for Denver to hear. The children were saying it after her. Four times Denver went to
look. The fifth time Lady Jones caught her and said, “Come in the front door, Miss Denver. This is not a
side show.”
So she had almost a whole year of the company of her peers and along with them learned to spell and
count. She was seven, and those two hours in the afternoon were precious to her. Especially so because
she had done it on her own and was pleased and surprised by the pleasure and surprise it created in her
mother and her brothers. For a nickel a month, Lady Jones did what whitepeople thought unnecessary if
not illegal: crowded her little parlor with the colored children who had time for and interest in book
learning. The nickel, tied to a handkerchief knot, tied to her belt, that she carried to Lady Jones, thrilled
her. The effort to handle chalk expertly and avoid the scream it would make; the capital w, the little i, the
beauty of the letters in her name, the deeply mournful sentences from the Bible Lady Jones used as a
textbook. Denver practiced every morning; starred every afternoon. She was so happy she didn’t even
know she was being avoided by her classmates—that they made excuses and altered their pace not to walk
with her. It was Nelson Lord—the boy as smart as she was—who put a stop to it; who asked her the
question about her mother that put chalk, the little i and all the rest that those afternoons held, out of reach
forever. She should have laughed when he said it, or pushed him down, but there was no meanness in his
face or his voice. Just curiosity. But the thing that leapt up in her when he asked it was a thing that had
been lying there all along.
She never went back. The second day she didn’t go, Sethe asked her why not. Denver didn’t answer.
She was too scared to ask her brothers or anyone else Nelson Lord’s question because certain odd and
terrifying feelings about her mother were collecting around the thing that leapt up inside her. Later on,
after Baby Suggs died, she did not wonder why Howard and Buglar had run away. She did not agree with
Sethe that they left because of the ghost. If so, what took them so long? They had lived with it as long as
she had. But if Nelson Lord was right—no wonder they were sulky, staying away from home as much as
they could.
Meanwhile the monstrous and unmanageable dreams about Sethe found release in the concentration
Denver began to fix on the baby ghost. Before Nelson Lord, she had been barely interested in its antics.
The patience of her mother and grandmother in its presence made her indifferent to it. Then it began to
irritate her, wear her out with its mischief. That was when she walked off to follow the children to Lady
Jones’ house-school. Now it held for her all the anger, love and fear she didn’t know what to do with.
Even when she did muster the courage to ask Nelson Lord’s question, she could not hear Sethe’s answer,
nor Baby Suggs’ words, nor anything at all thereafter. For two years she walked in a silence too solid for
penetration but which gave her eyes a power even she found hard to believe. The black nostrils of a
sparrow sitting on a branch sixty feet above her head, for instance. For two years she heard nothing at all
and then she heard close thunder crawling up the stairs. Baby Suggs thought it was Here Boy padding into
places he never went. Sethe thought it was the India-rubber ball the boys played with bounding down the
stairs.
“Is that damn dog lost his mind?” shouted Baby Suggs.
“He’s on the porch,” said Sethe. “See for yourself.”
“Well, what’s that I’m hearing then?”
Sethe slammed the stove lid. “Buglar! Buglar! I told you all not to use that ball in here.” She looked at
the white stairs and saw Denver at the top.
“She was trying to get upstairs.”
“What?” The cloth she used to handle the stove lid was balled in Sethe’s hand.
“The baby,” said Denver. “Didn’t you hear her crawling?”
What to jump on first was the problem: that Denver heard anything at all or that the crawling-already?
baby girl was still at it but more so.
The return of Denver’s hearing, cut off by an answer she could not bear to hear, cut on by the sound of
her dead sister trying to climb the stairs, signaled another shift in the fortunes of the people of 124. From
then on the presence was full of spite. Instead of sighs and accidents there was pointed and deliberate
abuse. Buglar and Howard grew furious at the company of the women in the house, and spent in sullen
reproach any time they had away from their odd work in town carrying water and feed at the stables. Until
the spite became so personal it drove each off. Baby Suggs grew tired, went to bed and stayed there until
her big old heart quit. Except for an occasional request for color she said practically nothing—until the
afternoon of the last day of her life when she got out of bed, skipped slowly to the door of the keeping
room and announced to Sethe and Denver the lesson she had learned from her sixty years a slave and ten
years free: that there was no bad luck in the world but whitepeople. “They don’t know when to stop,” she
said, and returned to her bed, pulled up the quilt and left them to hold that thought forever.
Shortly afterward Sethe and Denver tried to call up and reason with the baby ghost, but got nowhere.
It took a man, Paul D, to shout it off, beat it off and take its place for himself. And carnival or no carnival,
Denver preferred the venomous baby to him any day. During the first days after Paul D moved in, Denver
stayed in her emerald closet as long as she could, lonely as a mountain and almost as big, thinking
everybody had somebody but her; thinking even a ghost’s company was denied her. So when she saw the
black dress with two unlaced shoes beneath it she trembled with secret thanks. Whatever her power and
however she used it, Beloved was hers. Denver was alarmed by the harm she thought Beloved planned for
Sethe, but felt helpless to thwart it, so unrestricted was her need to love another. The display she witnessed
at the Clearing shamed her because the choice between Sethe and Beloved was without conflict.
Walking toward the stream, beyond her green bush house, she let herself wonder what if Beloved
really decided to choke her mother. Would she let it happen? Murder, Nelson Lord had said. “Didn’t your
mother get locked away for murder? Wasn’t you in there with her when she went?”
It was the second question that made it impossible for so long to ask Sethe about the first. The thing
that leapt up had been coiled in just such a place: a darkness, a stone, and some other thing that moved by
itself. She went deaf rather than hear the answer, and like the little four o’clocks that searched openly for
sunlight, then closed themselves tightly when it left, Denver kept watch for the baby and withdrew from
everything else. Until Paul D came. But the damage he did came undone with the miraculous resurrection
of Beloved.
Just ahead, at the edge of the stream, Denver could see her silhouette, standing barefoot in the water,
lifting her black skirts up above her calves, the beautiful head lowered in rapt attention.
Blinking fresh tears Denver approached her—eager for a word, a sign of forgiveness.
Denver took off her shoes and stepped into the water with her. It took a moment for her to drag her
eyes from the spectacle of Beloved’s head to see what she was staring at.
A turtle inched along the edge, turned and climbed to dry ground. Not far behind it was another one,
headed in the same direction. Four placed plates under a hovering motionless bowl. Behind her in the
grass the other one moving quickly, quickly to mount her. The impregnable strength of him—earthing his
feet near her shoulders. The embracing necks—hers stretching up toward his bending down, the pat pat
pat of their touching heads. No height was beyond her yearning neck, stretched like a finger toward his,
risking everything outside the bowl just to touch his face. The gravity of their shields, clashing, countered
and mocked the floating heads touching.
Beloved dropped the folds of her skirt. It spread around her. The hem darkened in the water.
OUT OF SIGHT of Mister’s sight, away, praise His name, from the smiling boss of roosters, Paul D
began to tremble. Not all at once and not so anyone could tell. When he turned his head, aiming for a last
look at Brother, turned it as much as the rope that connected his neck to the axle of a buckboard allowed,
and, later on, when they fastened the iron around his ankles and clamped the wrists as well, there was no
outward sign of trembling at all. Nor eighteen days after that when he saw the ditches; the one thousand
feet of earth—five feet deep, five feet wide, into which wooden boxes had been fitted. A door of bars that
you could lift on hinges like a cage opened into three walls and a roof of scrap lumber and red dirt. Two
feet of it over his head; three feet of open trench in front of him with anything that crawled or scurried
welcome to share that grave calling itself quarters. And there were forty-five more. He was sent there after
trying to kill Brandywine, the man schoolteacher sold him to. Brandywine was leading him, in a coffle
with ten others, through Kentucky into Virginia. He didn’t know exactly what prompted him to try—other
than Halle, Sixo, Paul A, Paul F and Mister. But the trembling was fixed by the time he knew it was there.
Still no one else knew it, because it began inside. A flutter of a kind, in the chest, then the shoulder
blades. It felt like rippling—gentle at first and then wild. As though the further south they led him the
more his blood, frozen like an ice pond for twenty years, began thawing, breaking into pieces that, once
melted, had no choice but to swirl and eddy. Sometimes it was in his leg. Then again it moved to the base
of his spine. By the time they unhitched him from the wagon and he saw nothing but dogs and two shacks
in a world of sizzling grass, the roiling blood was shaking him to and fro. But no one could tell. The wrists
he held out for the bracelets that evening were steady as were the legs he stood on when chains were
attached to the leg irons. But when they shoved him into the box and dropped the cage door down, his
hands quit taking instruction. On their own, they traveled. Nothing could stop them or get their attention.
They would not hold his penis to urinate or a spoon to scoop lumps of lima beans into his mouth. The
miracle of their obedience came with the hammer at dawn.
All forty-six men woke to rifle shot. All forty-six. Three whitemen walked along the trench unlocking
the doors one by one. No one stepped through. When the last lock was opened, the three returned and
lifted the bars, one by one. And one by one the blackmen emerged—promptly and without the poke of a
rifle butt if they had been there more than a day; promptly with the butt if, like Paul D, they had just
arrived. When all forty-six were standing in a line in the trench, another rifle shot signaled the climb out
and up to the ground above, where one thousand feet of the best hand-forged chain in Georgia stretched.
Each man bent and waited. The first man picked up the end and threaded it through the loop on his leg
iron. He stood up then, and, shuffling a little, brought the chain tip to the next prisoner, who did likewise.
As the chain was passed on and each man stood in the other’s place, the line of men turned around, facing
the boxes they had come out of. Not one spoke to the other. At least not with words. The eyes had to tell
what there was to tell: “Help me this mornin; ’s bad”; “I’m a make it”; “New man”; “Steady now steady.”
Chain-up completed, they knelt down. The dew, more likely than not, was mist by then. Heavy
sometimes and if the dogs were quiet and just breathing you could hear doves. Kneeling in the mist they
waited for the whim of a guard, or two, or three. Or maybe all of them wanted it. Wanted it from one
prisoner in particular or none—or all.
“Breakfast? Want some breakfast, nigger?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Hungry, nigger?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Here you go.”
Occasionally a kneeling man chose gunshot in his head as the price, maybe, of taking a bit of foreskin
with him to Jesus. Paul D did not know that then. He was looking at his palsied hands, smelling the guard,
listening to his soft grunts so like the doves’, as he stood before the man kneeling in mist on his right.
Convinced he was next, Paul D retched—vomiting up nothing at all. An observing guard smashed his
shoulder with the rifle and the engaged one decided to skip the new man for the time being lest his pants
and shoes got soiled by nigger puke.
“Hiiii!”
It was the first sound, other than “Yes, sir” a blackman was allowed to speak each morning, and the
lead chain gave it everything he had. “Hiiii!” It was never clear to Paul D how he knew when to shout that
mercy. They called him Hi Man and Paul D thought at first the guards told him when to give the signal
that let the prisoners rise up off their knees and dance two-step to the music of hand-forged iron. Later he
doubted it. He believed to this day that the “Hiiii!” at dawn and the “Hoooo!” when evening came were
the responsibility Hi Man assumed because he alone knew what was enough, what was too much, when
things were over, when the time had come.
They chain-danced over the fields, through the woods to a trail that ended in the astonishing beauty of
feldspar, and there Paul D’s hands disobeyed the furious rippling of his blood and paid attention. With a
sledge hammer in his hands and Hi Man’s lead, the men got through. They sang it out and beat it up,
garbling the words so they could not be understood; tricking the words so their syllables yielded up other
meanings. They sang the women they knew; the children they had been; the animals they had tamed
themselves or seen others tame. They sang of bosses and masters and misses; of mules and dogs and the
shamelessness of life. They sang lovingly of graveyards and sisters long gone. Of pork in the woods; meal
in the pan; fish on the line; cane, rain and rocking chairs.
And they beat. The women for having known them and no more, no more; the children for having
been them but never again. They killed a boss so often and so completely they had to bring him back to
life to pulp him one more time. Tasting hot mealcake among pine trees, they beat it away. Singing love
songs to Mr. Death, they smashed his head. More than the rest, they killed the flirt whom folks called Life
for leading them on. Making them think the next sunrise would be worth it; that another stroke of time
would do it at last. Only when she was dead would they be safe. The successful ones—the ones who had
been there enough years to have maimed, mutilated, maybe even buried her—kept watch over the others
who were still in her cock-teasing hug, caring and looking forward, remembering and looking back. They
were the ones whose eyes said, “Help me, ’s bad”; or “Look out,” meaning this might be the day I bay or
eat my own mess or run, and it was this last that had to be guarded against, for if one pitched and ran—all,
all forty-six, would be yanked by the chain that bound them and no telling who or how many would be
killed. A man could risk his own life, but not his brother’s. So the eyes said, “Steady now,” and “Hang by
me.”
Eighty-six days and done. Life was dead. Paul D beat her butt all day every day till there was not a
whimper in her. Eighty-six days and his hands were still, waiting serenely each rat-rustling night for
“Hiiii!” at dawn and the eager clench on the hammer’s shaft. Life rolled over dead. Or so he thought.
It rained.
Snakes came down from short-leaf pine and hemlock.
It rained.
Cypress, yellow poplar, ash and palmetto drooped under five days of rain without wind. By the eighth
day the doves were nowhere in sight, by the ninth even the salamanders were gone. Dogs laid their ears
down and stared over their paws. The men could not work. Chain-up was slow, breakfast abandoned, the
two-step became a slow drag over soupy grass and unreliable earth.
It was decided to lock everybody down in the boxes till it either stopped or lightened up so a whiteman
could walk, damnit, without flooding his gun and the dogs could quit shivering. The chain was threaded
through forty-six loops of the best hand-forged iron in Georgia.
It rained.
In the boxes the men heard the water rise in the trench and looked out for cottonmouths. They squatted
in muddy water, slept above it, peed in it. Paul D thought he was screaming; his mouth was open and there
was this loud throat-splitting sound—but it may have been somebody else. Then he thought he was crying.
Something was running down his cheeks. He lifted his hands to wipe away the tears and saw dark brown
slime. Above him rivulets of mud slid through the boards of the roof. When it come down, he thought,
gonna crush me like a tick bug. It happened so quick he had no time to ponder. Somebody yanked the
chain—once—hard enough to cross his legs and throw him into the mud. He never figured out how he
knew—how anybody did—but he did know—he did—and he took both hands and yanked the length of
chain at his left, so the next man would know too. The water was above his ankles, flowing over the
wooden plank he slept on. And then it wasn’t water anymore. The ditch was caving in and mud oozed
under and through the bars.
They waited—each and every one of the forty-six. Not screaming, although some of them must have
fought like the devil not to. The mud was up to his thighs and he held on to the bars. Then it came—
another yank—from the left this time and less forceful than the first because of the mud it passed through.
It started like the chain-up but the difference was the power of the chain. One by one, from Hi Man
back on down the line, they dove. Down through the mud under the bars, blind, groping. Some had sense
enough to wrap their heads in their shirts, cover their faces with rags, put on their shoes. Others just
plunged, simply ducked down and pushed out, fighting up, reaching for air. Some lost direction and their
neighbors, feeling the confused pull of the chain, snatched them around. For one lost, all lost. The chain
that held them would save all or none, and Hi Man was the Delivery. They talked through that chain like
Sam Morse and, Great God, they all came up. Like the unshriven dead, zombies on the loose, holding the
chains in their hands, they trusted the rain and the dark, yes, but mostly Hi Man and each other.
Past the sheds where the dogs lay in deep depression; past the two guard shacks, past the stable of
sleeping horses, past the hens whose bills were bolted into their feathers, they waded. The moon did not
help because it wasn’t there. The field was a marsh, the track a trough. All Georgia seemed to be sliding,
melting away. Moss wiped their faces as they fought the live-oak branches that blocked their way.
Georgia took up all of Alabama and Mississippi then, so there was no state line to cross and it wouldn’t
have mattered anyway. If they had known about it, they would have avoided not only Alfred and the
beautiful feldspar, but Savannah too and headed for the Sea Islands on the river that slid down from the
Blue Ridge Mountains. But they didn’t know.
Daylight came and they huddled in a copse of redbud trees. Night came and they scrambled up to
higher ground, praying the rain would go on shielding them and keeping folks at home. They were hoping
for a shack, solitary, some distance from its big house, where a slave might be making rope or heating
potatoes at the grate. What they found was a camp of sick Cherokee for whom a rose was named.
Decimated but stubborn, they were among those who chose a fugitive life rather than Oklahoma. The
illness that swept them now was reminiscent of the one that had killed half their number two hundred
years earlier. In between that calamity and this, they had visited George III in London, published a
newspaper, made baskets, led Oglethorpe through forests, helped Andrew Jackson fight Creek, cooked
maize, drawn up a constitution, petitioned the King of Spain, been experimented on by Dartmouth,
established asylums, wrote their language, resisted settlers, shot bear and translated scripture. All to no
avail. The forced move to the Arkansas River, insisted upon by the same president they fought for against
the Creek, destroyed another quarter of their already shattered number.
That was it, they thought, and removed themselves from those Cherokee who signed the treaty, in
order to retire into the forest and await the end of the world. The disease they suffered now was a mere
inconvenience compared to the devastation they remembered. Still, they protected each other as best they
could. The healthy were sent some miles away; the sick stayed behind with the dead—to survive or join
them.
The prisoners from Alfred, Georgia, sat down in semicircle near the encampment. No one came and
still they sat. Hours passed and the rain turned soft. Finally a woman stuck her head out of her house.
Night came and nothing happened. At dawn two men with barnacles covering their beautiful skin
approached them. No one spoke for a moment, then Hi Man raised his hand. The Cherokee saw the chains
and went away. When they returned each carried a handful of small axes. Two children followed with a
pot of mush cooling and thinning in the rain.
Buffalo men, they called them, and talked slowly to the prisoners scooping mush and tapping away at
their chains. Nobody from a box in Alfred, Georgia, cared about the illness the Cherokee warned them
about, so they stayed, all forty-six, resting, planning their next move. Paul D had no idea of what to do and
knew less than anybody, it seemed. He heard his co-convicts talk knowledgeably of rivers and states,
towns and territories. Heard Cherokee men describe the beginning of the world and its end. Listened to
tales of other Buffalo men they knew—three of whom were in the healthy camp a few miles away. Hi
Man wanted to join them; others wanted to join him. Some wanted to leave; some to stay on. Weeks later
Paul D was the only Buffalo man left—without a plan. All he could think of was tracking dogs, although
Hi Man said the rain they left in gave that no chance of success. Alone, the last man with buffalo hair
among the ailing Cherokee, Paul D finally woke up and, admitting his ignorance, asked how he might get
North. Free North. Magical North. Welcoming, benevolent North. The Cherokee smiled and looked
around. The flood rains of a month ago had turned everything to steam and blossoms.
“That way,” he said, pointing. “Follow the tree flowers,” he said. “Only the tree flowers. As they go,
you go. You will be where you want to be when they are gone.”
So he raced from dogwood to blossoming peach. When they thinned out he headed for the cherry
blossoms, then magnolia, chinaberry, pecan, walnut and prickly pear. At last he reached a field of apple
trees whose flowers were just becoming tiny knots of fruit. Spring sauntered north, but he had to run like
hell to keep it as his traveling companion. From February to July he was on the lookout for blossoms.
When he lost them, and found himself without so much as a petal to guide him, he paused, climbed a tree
on a hillock and scanned the horizon for a flash of pink or white in the leaf world that surrounded him. He
did not touch them or stop to smell. He merely followed in their wake, a dark ragged figure guided by the
blossoming plums.
The apple field turned out to be Delaware where the weaver lady lived. She snapped him up as soon as
he finished the sausage she fed him and he crawled into her bed crying. She passed him off as her nephew
from Syracuse simply by calling him that nephew’s name. Eighteen months and he was looking out again
for blossoms only this time he did the looking on a dray.
It was some time before he could put Alfred, Georgia, Sixo, schoolteacher, Halle, his brothers, Sethe,
Mister, the taste of iron, the sight of butter, the smell of hickory, notebook paper, one by one, into the
tobacco tin lodged in his chest. By the time he got to 124 nothing in this world could pry it open.
SHE MOVED HIM.
Not the way he had beat off the baby’s ghost—all bang and shriek with windows smashed and jelly
jars rolled in a heap. But she moved him nonetheless, and Paul D didn’t know how to stop it because it
looked like he was moving himself. Imperceptibly, downright reasonably, he was moving out of 124.
The beginning was so simple. One day, after supper, he sat in the rocker by the stove, bone-tired,
river-whipped, and fell asleep. He woke to the footsteps of Sethe coming down the white stairs to make
breakfast.
“I thought you went out somewhere,” she said.
Paul D moaned, surprised to find himself exactly where he was the last time he looked.
“Don’t tell me I slept in this chair the whole night.”
Sethe laughed. “Me? I won’t say a word to you.”
“Why didn’t you rouse me?”
“I did. Called you two or three times. I gave it up around midnight and then I thought you went out
somewhere.”
He stood, expecting his back to fight it. But it didn’t. Not a creak or a stiff joint anywhere. In fact he
felt refreshed. Some things are like that, he thought, good-sleep places. The base of certain trees here and
there; a wharf, a bench, a rowboat once, a haystack usually, not always bed, and here, now, a rocking
chair, which was strange because in his experience furniture was the worst place for a good-sleep sleep.
The next evening he did it again and then again. He was accustomed to sex with Sethe just about every
day, and to avoid the confusion Beloved’s shining caused him he still made it his business to take her back
upstairs in the morning, or lie down with her after supper. But he found a way and a reason to spend the
longest part of the night in the rocker. He told himself it must be his back—something supportive it
needed for a weakness left over from sleeping in a box in Georgia.
It went on that way and might have stayed that way but one evening, after supper, after Sethe, he came
downstairs, sat in the rocker and didn’t want to be there. He stood up and realized he didn’t want to go
upstairs either. Irritable and longing for rest, he opened the door to Baby Suggs’ room and dropped off to
sleep on the bed the old lady died in. That settled it—so it seemed. It became his room and Sethe didn’t
object—her bed made for two had been occupied by one for eighteen years before Paul D came to call.
And maybe it was better this way, with young girls in the house and him not being her true-to-life
husband. In any case, since there was no reduction in his before-breakfast or after-supper appetites, he
never heard her complain.
It went on that way and might have stayed that way, except one evening, after supper, after Sethe, he
came downstairs and lay on Baby Suggs’ bed and didn’t want to be there.
He believed he was having house-fits, the glassy anger men sometimes feel when a woman’s house
begins to bind them, when they want to yell and break something or at least run off. He knew all about
that—felt it lots of times—in the Delaware weaver’s house, for instance. But always he associated the
house-fit with the woman in it. This nervousness had nothing to do with the woman, whom he loved a
little bit more every day: her hands among vegetables, her mouth when she licked a thread end before
guiding it through a needle or bit it in two when the seam was done, the blood in her eye when she
defended her girls (and Beloved was hers now) or any coloredwoman from a slur. Also in this house-fit
there was no anger, no suffocation, no yearning to be elsewhere. He just could not, would not, sleep
upstairs or in the rocker or, now, in Baby Suggs’ bed. So he went to the storeroom.
It went on that way and might have stayed that way except one evening, after supper, after Sethe, he
lay on a pallet in the storeroom and didn’t want to be there. Then it was the cold house and it was out
there, separated from the main part of 124, curled on top of two croaker sacks full of sweet potatoes,
staring at the sides of a lard can, that he realized the moving was involuntary. He wasn’t being nervous; he
was being prevented.
So he waited. Visited Sethe in the morning; slept in the cold room at night and waited.
She came, and he wanted to knock her down.
In Ohio seasons are theatrical. Each one enters like a prima donna, convinced its performance is the
reason the world has people in it. When Paul D had been forced out of 124 into a shed behind it, summer
had been hooted offstage and autumn with its bottles of blood and gold had everybody’s attention. Even at
night, when there should have been a restful intermission, there was none because the voices of a dying
landscape were insistent and loud. Paul D packed newspaper under himself and over, to give his thin
blanket some help. But the chilly night was not on his mind. When he heard the door open behind him he
refused to turn and look.
“What you want in here? What you want?” He should have been able to hear her breathing.
“I want you to touch me on the inside part and call me my name.”
Paul D never worried about his little tobacco tin anymore. It was rusted shut. So, while she hoisted her
skirts and turned her head over her shoulder the way the turtles had, he just looked at the lard can, silvery
in moonlight, and spoke quietly.
“When good people take you in and treat you good, you ought to try to be good back. You
don’t…Sethe loves you. Much as her own daughter. You know that.”
Beloved dropped her skirts as he spoke and looked at him with empty eyes. She took a step he could
not hear and stood close behind him.
“She don’t love me like I love her. I don’t love nobody but her.”
“Then what you come in here for?”
“I want you to touch me on the inside part.”
“Go on back in that house and get to bed.”
“You have to touch me. On the inside part. And you have to call me my name.”
As long as his eyes were locked on the silver of the lard can he was safe. If he trembled like Lot’s wife
and felt some womanish need to see the nature of the sin behind him; feel a sympathy, perhaps, for the
cursing cursed, or want to hold it in his arms out of respect for the connection between them, he too would
be lost.
“Call me my name.”
“No.”
“Please call it. I’ll go if you call it.”
“Beloved.” He said it, but she did not go. She moved closer with a footfall he didn’t hear and he didn’t
hear the whisper that the flakes of rust made either as they fell away from the seams of his tobacco tin. So
when the lid gave he didn’t know it. What he knew was that when he reached the inside part he was
saying, “Red heart. Red heart,” over and over again. Softly and then so loud it woke Denver, then Paul D
himself. “Red heart. Red heart. Red heart.”
TO GO BACK to the original hunger was impossible. Luckily for Denver, looking was food enough to
last. But to be looked at in turn was beyond appetite; it was breaking through her own skin to a place
where hunger hadn’t been discovered. It didn’t have to happen often, because Beloved seldom looked
right at her, or when she did, Denver could tell that her own face was just the place those eyes stopped
while the mind behind it walked on. But sometimes—at moments Denver could neither anticipate nor
create—Beloved rested cheek on knuckles and looked at Denver with attention.
It was lovely. Not to be stared at, not seen, but being pulled into view by the interested, uncritical eyes
of the other. Having her hair examined as a part of her self, not as material or a style. Having her lips,
nose, chin caressed as they might be if she were a moss rose a gardener paused to admire. Denver’s skin
dissolved under that gaze and became soft and bright like the lisle dress that had its arm around her
mother’s waist. She floated near but outside her own body, feeling vague and intense at the same time.
Needing nothing. Being what there was.
At such times it seemed to be Beloved who needed something—wanted something. Deep down in her
wide black eyes, back behind the expressionlessness, was a palm held out for a penny which Denver
would gladly give her, if only she knew how or knew enough about her, a knowledge not to be had by the
answers to the questions Sethe occasionally put to her: “You disremember everything? I never knew my
mother neither, but I saw her a couple of times. Did you never see yours? What kind of whites was they?
You don’t remember none?”
Beloved, scratching the back of her hand, would say she remembered a woman who was hers, and she
remembered being snatched away from her. Other than that, the clearest memory she had, the one she
repeated, was the bridge—standing on the bridge looking down. And she knew one whiteman.
Sethe found that remarkable and more evidence to support her conclusions, which she confided to
Denver.
“Where’d you get the dress, them shoes?”
Beloved said she took them.
“Who from?”
Silence and a faster scratching of her hand. She didn’t know; she saw them and just took them.
“Uh huh,” said Sethe, and told Denver that she believed Beloved had been locked up by some
whiteman for his own purposes, and never let out the door. That she must have escaped to a bridge or
someplace and rinsed the rest out of her mind. Something like that had happened to Ella except it was two
men—a father and son—and Ella remembered every bit of it. For more than a year, they kept her locked
in a room for themselves.
“You couldn’t think up,” Ella had said, “what them two done to me.”
Sethe thought it explained Beloved’s behavior around Paul D, whom she hated so.
Denver neither believed nor commented on Sethe’s speculations, and she lowered her eyes and never
said a word about the cold house. She was certain that Beloved was the white dress that had knelt with her
mother in the keeping room, the true-to-life presence of the baby that had kept her company most of her
life. And to be looked at by her, however briefly, kept her grateful for the rest of the time when she was
merely the looker. Besides, she had her own set of questions which had nothing to do with the past. The
present alone interested Denver, but she was careful to appear uninquisitive about the things she was
dying to ask Beloved, for if she pressed too hard, she might lose the penny that the held-out palm wanted,
and lose, therefore, the place beyond appetite. It was better to feast, to have per mission to be the looker,
because the old hunger—the before-Beloved hunger that drove her into boxwood and cologne for just a
taste of a life, to feel it bumpy and not flat—was out of the question. Looking kept it at bay.
So she did not ask Beloved how she knew about the earrings, the night walks to the cold house or the
tip of the thing she saw when Beloved lay down or came undone in her sleep. The look, when it came,
came when Denver had been careful, had explained things, or participated in things, or told stories to keep
her occupied when Sethe was at the restaurant. No given chore was enough to put out the licking fire that
seemed always to burn in her. Not when they wrung out sheets so tight the rinse water ran back up their
arms. Not when they shoveled snow from the path to the outhouse. Or broke three inches of ice from the
rain barrel; scoured and boiled last summer’s canning jars, packed mud in the cracks of the hen house and
warmed the chicks with their skirts. All the while Denver was obliged to talk about what they were
doing—the how and why of it. About people Denver knew once or had seen, giving them more life than
life had: the sweet-smelling whitewoman who brought her oranges and cologne and good wool skirts;
Lady Jones who taught them songs to spell and count by; a beautiful boy as smart as she was with a
birthmark like a nickel on his cheek. A white preacher who prayed for their souls while Sethe peeled
potatoes and Grandma Baby sucked air. And she told her about Howard and Buglar: the parts of the bed
that belonged to each (the top reserved for herself); that before she transferred to Baby Suggs’ bed she
never knew them to sleep without holding hands. She described them to Beloved slowly, to keep her
attention, dwelling on their habits, the games they taught her and not the fright that drove them
increasingly out of the house—anywhere—and finally far away.
This day they are outside. It’s cold and the snow is hard as packed dirt. Denver has finished singing
the counting song Lady Jones taught her students. Beloved is holding her arms steady while Denver
unclasps frozen underwear and towels from the line. One by one she lays them in Beloved’s arms until the
pile, like a huge deck of cards, reaches her chin. The rest, aprons and brown stockings, Denver carries
herself. Made giddy by the cold, they return to the house. The clothes will thaw slowly to a dampness
perfect for the pressing iron, which will make them smell like hot rain. Dancing around the room with
Sethe’s apron, Beloved wants to know if there are flowers in the dark. Denver adds sticks to the stovefire
and assures her there are. Twirling, her face framed by the neckband, her waist in the apron strings’
embrace, she says she is thirsty.
Denver suggests warming up some cider, while her mind races to something she might do or say to
interest and entertain the dancer. Denver is a strategist now and has to keep Beloved by her side from the
minute Sethe leaves for work until the hour of her return when Beloved begins to hover at the window,
then work her way out the door, down the steps and near the road. Plotting has changed Denver markedly.
Where she was once indolent, resentful of every task, now she is spry, executing, even extending the
assignments Sethe leaves for them. All to be able to say “We got to” and “Ma’am said for us to.”
Otherwise Beloved gets private and dreamy, or quiet and sullen, and Denver’s chances of being looked at
by her go down to nothing. She has no control over the evenings. When her mother is anywhere around,
Beloved has eyes only for Sethe. At night, in bed, anything might happen. She might want to be told a
story in the dark when Denver can’t see her. Or she might get up and go into the cold house where Paul D
has begun to sleep. Or she might cry, silently. She might even sleep like a brick, her breath sugary from
fingerfuls of molasses or sand-cookie crumbs. Denver will turn toward her then, and if Beloved faces her,
she will inhale deeply the sweet air from her mouth. If not, she will have to lean up and over her, every
once in a while, to catch a sniff. For anything is better than the original hunger—the time when, after a
year of the wonderful little i, sentences rolling out like pie dough and the company of other children, there
was no sound coming through. Anything is better than the silence when she answered to hands gesturing
and was indifferent to the movement of lips. When she saw every little thing and colors leaped smoldering
into view. She will forgo the most violent of sunsets, stars as fat as dinner plates and all the blood of
autumn and settle for the palest yellow if it comes from her Beloved.
The cider jug is heavy, but it always is, even when empty. Denver can carry it easily, yet she asks
Beloved to help her. It is in the cold house next to the molasses and six pounds of cheddar hard as bone. A
pallet is in the middle of the floor covered with newspaper and a blanket at the foot. It has been slept on
for almost a month, even though snow has come and, with it, serious winter.
It is noon, quite light outside; inside it is not. A few cuts of sun break through the roof and walls but
once there they are too weak to shift for themselves. Darkness is stronger and swallows them like
minnows.
The door bangs shut. Denver can’t tell where Beloved is standing.
“Where are you?” she whispers in a laughing sort of way.
“Here,” says Beloved.
“Where?”
“Come find me,” says Beloved.
Denver stretches out her right arm and takes a step or two. She trips and falls down onto the pallet.
Newspaper crackles under her weight. She laughs again. “Oh, shoot. Beloved?”
No one answers. Denver waves her arms and squinches her eyes to separate the shadows of potato
sacks, a lard can and a side of smoked pork from the one that might be human.
“Stop fooling,” she says and looks up toward the light to check and make sure this is still the cold
house and not something going on in her sleep. The minnows of light still swim there; they can’t make it
down to where she is.
“You the one thirsty. You want cider or don’t you?” Denver’s voice is mildly accusatory. Mildly. She
doesn’t want to offend and she doesn’t want to betray the panic that is creeping over her like hairs. There
is no sight or sound of Beloved. Denver struggles to her feet amid the crackling newspaper. Holding her
palm out, she moves slowly toward the door. There is no latch or knob—just a loop of wire to catch a nail.
She pushes the door open. Cold sunlight displaces the dark. The room is just as it was when they
entered—except Beloved is not there. There is no point in looking further, for everything in the place can
be seen at first sight. Denver looks anyway because the loss is ungovernable. She steps back into the shed,
allowing the door to close quickly behind her. Darkness or not, she moves rapidly around, reaching,
touching cobwebs, cheese, slanting shelves, the pallet interfering with each step. If she stumbles, she is not
aware of it because she does not know where her body stops, which part of her is an arm, a foot or a knee.
She feels like an ice cake torn away from the solid surface of the stream, floating on darkness, thick and
crashing against the edges of things around it. Breakable, meltable and cold.
It is hard to breathe and even if there were light she wouldn’t be able to see anything because she is
crying. Just as she thought it might happen, it has. Easy as walking into a room. A magical appearance on
a stump, the face wiped out by sunlight, and a magical disappearance in a shed, eaten alive by the dark.
“Don’t,” she is saying between tough swallows. “Don’t. Don’t go back.”
This is worse than when Paul D came to 124 and she cried helplessly into the stove. This is worse.
Then it was for herself. Now she is crying because she has no self. Death is a skipped meal compared to
this. She can feel her thickness thinning, dissolving into nothing. She grabs the hair at her temples to get
enough to uproot it and halt the melting for a while. Teeth clamped shut, Denver brakes her sobs. She
doesn’t move to open the door because there is no world out there. She decides to stay in the cold house
and let the dark swallow her like the minnows of light above. She won’t put up with another leaving,
another trick. Waking up to find one brother then another not at the bottom of the bed, his foot jabbing her
spine. Sitting at the table eating turnips and saving the liquor for her grandmother to drink; her mother’s
hand on the keeping-room door and her voice saying, “Baby Suggs is gone, Denver.” And when she got
around to worrying about what would be the case if Sethe died or Paul D took her away, a dream-cometrue comes true just to leave her on a pile of newspaper in the dark.
No footfall announces her, but there she is, standing where before there was nobody when Denver
looked. And smiling.
Denver grabs the hem of Beloved’s skirt. “I thought you left me. I thought you went back.”
Beloved smiles, “I don’t want that place. This the place I am.” She sits down on the pallet and,
laughing, lies back looking at the cracklights above.
Surreptitiously, Denver pinches a piece of Beloved’s skirt between her fingers and holds on. A good
thing she does because suddenly Beloved sits up.
“What is it?” asks Denver.
“Look,” she points to the sunlit cracks.
“What? I don’t see nothing.” Denver follows the pointing finger.
Beloved drops her hand. “I’m like this.”
Denver watches as Beloved bends over, curls up and rocks. Her eyes go to no place; her moaning is so
small Denver can hardly hear it.
“You all right? Beloved?”
Beloved focuses her eyes. “Over there. Her face.”
Denver looks where Beloved’s eyes go; there is nothing but darkness there.
“Whose face? Who is it?”
“Me. It’s me.”
She is smiling again.
THE LAST of the Sweet Home men, so named and called by one who would know, believed it. The other
four believed it too, once, but they were long gone. The sold one never returned, the lost one never found.
One, he knew, was dead for sure; one he hoped was, because butter and clabber was no life or reason to
live it. He grew up thinking that, of all the Blacks in Kentucky, only the five of them were men. Allowed,
encouraged to correct Garner, even defy him. To invent ways of doing things; to see what was needed and
attack it without permission. To buy a mother, choose a horse or a wife, handle guns, even learn reading if
they wanted to—but they didn’t want to since nothing important to them could be put down on paper.
Was that it? Is that where the manhood lay? In the naming done by a whiteman who was supposed to
know? Who gave them the privilege not of working but of deciding how to? No. In their relationship with
Garner was true metal: they were believed and trusted, but most of all they were listened to.
He thought what they said had merit, and what they felt was serious. Deferring to his slaves’ opinions
did not deprive him of authority or power. It was schoolteacher who taught them otherwise. A truth that
waved like a scarecrow in rye: they were only Sweet Home men at Sweet Home. One step off that ground
and they were trespassers among the human race. Watchdogs without teeth; steer bulls without horns;
gelded workhorses whose neigh and whinny could not be translated into a language responsible humans
spoke. His strength had lain in knowing that schoolteacher was wrong. Now he wondered. There was
Alfred, Georgia, there was Delaware, there was Sixo and still he wondered. If schoolteacher was right it
explained how he had come to be a rag doll—picked up and put back down anywhere any time by a girl
young enough to be his daughter. Fucking her when he was convinced he didn’t want to. Whenever she
turned her behind up, the calves of his youth (was that it?) cracked his resolve. But it was more than
appetite that humiliated him and made him wonder if schoolteacher was right. It was being moved, placed
where she wanted him, and there was nothing he was able to do about it. For his life he could not walk up
the glistening white stairs in the evening; for his life he could not stay in the kitchen, in the keeping room,
in the storeroom at night. And he tried. Held his breath the way he had when he ducked into the mud;
steeled his heart the way he had when the trembling began. But it was worse than that, worse than the
blood eddy he had controlled with a sledge hammer. When he stood up from the supper table at 124 and
turned toward the stairs, nausea was first, then repulsion. He, he. He who had eaten raw meat barely dead,
who under plum trees bursting with blossoms had crunched through a dove’s breast before its heart
stopped beating. Because he was a man and a man could do what he would: be still for six hours in a dry
well while night dropped; fight raccoon with his hands and win; watch another man, whom he loved better
than his brothers, roast without a tear just so the roasters would know what a man was like. And it was he,
that man, who had walked from Georgia to Delaware, who could not go or stay put where he wanted to in
124—shame.
Paul D could not command his feet, but he thought he could still talk and he made up his mind to
break out that way. He would tell Sethe about the last three weeks: catch her alone coming from work at
the beer garden she called a restaurant and tell it all.
He waited for her. The winter afternoon looked like dusk as he stood in the alley behind Sawyer’s
Restaurant. Rehearsing, imagining her face and letting the words flock in his head like kids before lining
up to follow the leader.
“Well, ah, this is not the, a man can’t, see, but aw listen here, it ain’t that, it really ain’t, Ole Garner,
what I mean is, it ain’t a weakness, the kind of weakness I can fight ’cause ’cause something is happening
to me, that girl is doing it, I know you think I never liked her nohow, but she is doing it to me. Fixing me.
Sethe, she’s fixed me and I can’t break it.”
What? A grown man fixed by a girl? But what if the girl was not a girl, but something in disguise? A
lowdown something that looked like a sweet young girl and fucking her or not was not the point, it was
not being able to stay or go where he wished in 124, and the danger was in losing Sethe because he was
not man enough to break out, so he needed her, Sethe, to help him, to know about it, and it shamed him to
have to ask the woman he wanted to protect to help him do it, God damn it to hell.
Paul D blew warm breath into the hollow of his cupped hands. The wind raced down the alley so fast
it sleeked the fur of four kitchen dogs waiting for scraps. He looked at the dogs. The dogs looked at him.
Finally the back door opened and Sethe stepped through holding a scrap pan in the crook of her arm.
When she saw him, she said Oh, and her smile was both pleasure and surprise.
Paul D believed he smiled back but his face was so cold he wasn’t sure.
“Man, you make me feel like a girl, coming by to pick me up after work. Nobody ever did that before.
You better watch out, I might start looking forward to it.” She tossed the largest bones into the dirt rapidly
so the dogs would know there was enough and not fight each other. Then she dumped the skins of some
things, heads of other things and the insides of still more things—what the restaurant could not use and
she would not—in a smoking pile near the animals’ feet.
“Got to rinse this out,” she said, “and then I’ll be right with you.”
He nodded as she returned to the kitchen.
The dogs ate without sound and Paul D thought they at least got what they came for, and if she had
enough for them—
The cloth on her head was brown wool and she edged it down over her hairline against the wind.
“You get off early or what?”
“I took off early.”
“Anything the matter?”
“In a way of speaking,” he said and wiped his lips.
“Not cut back?”
“No, no. They got plenty work. I just “
“Hm?”
“Sethe, you won’t like what I’m ’bout to say.”
She stopped then and turned her face toward him and the hateful wind. Another woman would have
squinted or at least teared if the wind whipped her face as it did Sethe’s. Another woman might have shot
him a look of apprehension, pleading, anger even, because what he said sure sounded like part one of
Goodbye, I’m gone.
Sethe looked at him steadily, calmly, already ready to accept, release or excuse an in-need-or-trouble
man. Agreeing, saying okay, all right, in advance, because she didn’t believe any of them—over the long
haul—could measure up. And whatever the reason, it was all right. No fault. Nobody’s fault.
He knew what she was thinking and even though she was wrong—he was not leaving her, wouldn’t
ever—the thing he had in mind to tell her was going to be worse. So, when he saw the diminished
expectation in her eyes, the melancholy without blame, he could not say it. He could not say to this
woman who did not squint in the wind,”I am not a man.”
“Well, say it, Paul D, whether I like it or not.”
Since he could not say what he planned to, he said something he didn’t know was on his mind. “I want
you pregnant, Sethe. Would you do that for me?”
Now she was laughing and so was he.
“You came by here to ask me that? You are one crazy-headed man. You right; I don’t like it. Don’t
you think I’m too old to start that all over again?” She slipped her fingers in his hand for all the world like
the hand-holding shadows on the side of the road.
“Think about it,” he said. And suddenly it was a solution: a way to hold on to her, document his
manhood and break out of the girl’s spell—all in one. He put the tips of Sethe’s fingers on his cheek.
Laughing, she pulled them away lest somebody passing the alley see them misbehaving in public, in
daylight, in the wind.
Still, he’d gotten a little more time, bought it, in fact, and hoped the price wouldn’t wreck him. Like
paying for an afternoon in the coin of life to come.
They left off playing, let go hands and hunched forward as they left the alley and entered the street.
The wind was quieter there but the dried-out cold it left behind kept pedestrians fast-moving, stiff inside
their coats. No men leaned against door frames or storefront windows. The wheels of wagons delivering
feed or wood screeched as though they hurt. Hitched horses in front of the saloons shivered and closed
their eyes. Four women, walking two abreast, approached, their shoes loud on the wooden walkway. Paul
D touched Sethe’s elbow to guide her as they stepped from the slats to the dirt to let the women pass.
Half an hour later, when they reached the city’s edge, Sethe and Paul D resumed catching and
snatching each other’s fingers, stealing quick pats on the behind. Joyfully embarrassed to be that grown-up
and that young at the same time.
Resolve, he thought. That was all it took, and no motherless gal was going to break it up. No lazy,
stray pup of a woman could turn him around, make him doubt himself, wonder, plead or confess,
Convinced of it, that he could do it, he threw his arm around Sethe’s shoulders and squeezed. She let her
head touch his chest, and since the moment was valuable to both of them, they stopped and stood that
way—not breathing, not even caring if a passerby passed them by. The winter light was low. Sethe closed
her eyes. Paul D looked at the black trees lining the roadside, their defending arms raised against attack.
Softly, suddenly, it began to snow, like a present come down from the sky. Sethe opened her eyes to it and
said, “Mercy.” And it seemed to Paul D that it was—a little mercy—something given to them on purpose
to mark what they were feeling so they would remember it later on when they needed to.
Down came the dry flakes, fat enough and heavy enough to crash like nickels on stone. It always
surprised him, how quiet it was. Not like rain, but like a secret.
“Run!” he said.
“You run,” said Sethe. “I been on my feet all day.”
“Where I been? Sitting down?” and he pulled her along.
“Stop! Stop!” she said. “I don’t have the legs for this.”
“Then give em to me,” he said and before she knew it he had backed into her, hoisted her on his back
and was running down the road past brown fields turning white.
Breathless at last, he stopped and she slid back down on her own two feet, weak from laughter.
“You need some babies, somebody to play with in the snow.” Sethe secured her headcloth.
Paul D smiled and warmed his hands with his breath. “I sure would like to give it a try. Need a willing
partner though.”
“I’ll say,” she answered. “Very, very willing.”
It was nearly four o’clock now and 124 was half a mile ahead. Floating toward them, barely visible in
the drifting snow, was a figure, and although it was the same figure that had been meeting Sethe for four
months, so complete was the attention she and Paul D were paying to themselves they both felt a jolt when
they saw her close in.
Beloved did not look at Paul D; her scrutiny was for Sethe. She had no coat, no wrap, nothing on her
head, but she held in her hands a long shawl. Stretching out her arms she tried to circle it around Sethe.
“Crazy girl,” said Sethe. “You the one out here with nothing on.” And stepping away and in front of
Paul D, Sethe took the shawl and wrapped it around Beloved’s head and shoulders. Saying, “You got to
learn more sense than that,” she enclosed her in her left arm. Snowflakes stuck now. Paul D felt icy cold in
the place Sethe had been before Beloved came. Trailing a yard or so behind the women, he fought the
anger that shot through his stomach all the way home. When he saw Denver silhouetted in the lamplight at
the window, he could not help thinking, “And whose ally you?”
It was Sethe who did it. Unsuspecting, surely, she solved everything with one blow.
“Now I know you not sleeping out there tonight, are you, Paul D?” She smiled at him, and like a
friend in need, the chimney coughed against the rush of cold shooting into it from the sky. Window sashes
shuddered in a blast of winter air.
Paul D looked up from the stew meat.
“You come upstairs. Where you belong,” she said, “…and stay there.”
The threads of malice creeping toward him from Beloved’s side of the table were held harmless in the
warmth of Sethe’s smile.
Once before (and only once) Paul D had been grateful to a woman. Crawling out of the woods, crosseyed with hunger and loneliness, be knocked at the first back door he came to in the colored section of
Wilmington. He told the woman who opened it that he’d appreciate doing her woodpile, if she could spare
him something to eat. She looked him up and down.
“A little later on,” she said and opened the door wider. She fed him pork sausage, the worst thing in
the world for a starving man, but neither he nor his stomach objected. Later, when he saw pale cotton
sheets and two pillows in her bedroom, he had to wipe his eyes quickly, quickly so she would not see the
thankful tears of a man’s first time. Soil, grass, mud, shucking, leaves, hay, cobs, seashells—all that he’d
slept on. White cotton sheets had never crossed his mind. He fell in with a groan and the woman helped
him pretend he was making love to her and not her bed linen. He vowed that night, full of pork, deep in
luxury, that he would never leave her. She would have to kill him to get him out of that bed. Eighteen
months later, when he had been purchased by Northpoint Bank and Railroad Company, he was still
thankful for that introduction to sheets.
Now he was grateful a second time. He felt as though he had been plucked from the face of a cliff and
put down on sure ground. In Sethe’s bed he knew he could put up with two crazy girls—as long as Sethe
made her wishes known. Stretched out to his full length, watching snowflakes stream past the window
over his feet, it was easy to dismiss the doubts that took him to the alley behind the restaurant: his
expectations for himself were high, too high. What he might call cowardice other people called common
sense.
Tucked into the well of his arm, Sethe recalled Paul D’s face in the street when he asked her to have a
baby for him. Although she laughed and took his hand, it had frightened her. She thought quickly of how
good the sex would be if that is what he wanted, but mostly she was frightened by the thought of having a
baby once more. Needing to be good enough, alert enough, strong enough, that caring—again. Having to
stay alive just that much longer. O Lord, she thought, deliver me. Unless carefree, motherlove was a killer.
What did he want her pregnant for? To hold on to her? have a sign that he passed this way? He probably
had children everywhere anyway. Eighteen years of roaming, he would have to have dropped a few. No.
He resented the children she had, that’s what. Child, she corrected herself. Child plus Beloved whom she
thought of as her own, and that is what he resented. Sharing her with the girls. Hearing the three of them
laughing at something he wasn’t in on. The code they used among themselves that he could not break.
Maybe even the time spent on their needs and not his. They were a family somehow and he was not the
head of it.
Can you stitch this up for me, baby?
Um hm. Soon’s I finish this petticoat. She just got the one she came here in and everybody needs a
change.
Any pie left?
I think Denver got the last of it.
And not complaining, not even minding that he slept all over and around the house now, which she put
a stop to this night out of courtesy.
Sethe sighed and placed her hand on his chest. She knew she was building a case against him in order
to build a case against getting pregnant, and it shamed her a little. But she had all the children she needed.
If her boys came back one day, and Denver and Beloved stayed on-well, it would be the way it was
supposed to be, no? Right after she saw the shadows holding hands at the side of the road hadn’t the
picture altered? And the minute she saw the dress and shoes sitting in the front yard, she broke water.
Didn’t even have to see the face burning in the sunlight. She had been dreaming it for years.
Paul D’s chest rose and fell, rose and fell under her hand.
DENVER FINISHED washing the dishes and sat down at the table. Beloved, who had not moved since
Sethe and Paul D left the room, sat sucking her forefinger. Denver watched her face awhile and then said,
“She likes him here.”
Beloved went on probing her mouth with her finger. “Make him go away,” she said.
“She might be mad at you if he leaves.”
Beloved, inserting a thumb in her mouth along with the forefinger, pulled out a back tooth. There was
hardly any blood, but Denver said, “Ooooh, didn’t that hurt you?”
Beloved looked at the tooth and thought, This is it. Next would be her arm, her hand, a toe. Pieces of
her would drop maybe one at a time, maybe all at once. Or on one of those mornings before Denver woke
and after Sethe left she would fly apart. It is difficult keeping her head on her neck, her legs attached to
her hips when she is by herself. Among the things she could not remember was when she first knew that
she could wake up any day and find herself in pieces. She had two dreams: exploding, and being
swallowed. When her tooth came out—an odd fragment, last in the row—she thought it was starting.
“Must be a wisdom,” said Denver. “Don’t it hurt?”
“Yes.”
“Then why don’t you cry?”
“What?”
“If it hurts, why don’t you cry?”
And she did. Sitting there holding a small white tooth in the palm of her smooth smooth hand. Cried
the way she wanted to when turtles came out of the water, one behind the other, right after the blood-red
bird disappeared back into the leaves. The way she wanted to when Sethe went to him standing in the tub
under the stairs. With the tip of her tongue she touched the salt water that slid to the corner of her mouth
and hoped Denver’s arm around her shoulders would keep them from falling apart.
The couple upstairs, united, didn’t hear a sound, but below them, outside, all around 124 the snow
went on and on and on. Piling itself, burying itself. Higher. Deeper.
IN THE BACK of Baby Suggs’ mind may have been the thought that if Halle made it, God do what He
would, it would be a cause for celebration. lf only this final son could do for himself what he had done for
her and for the three children John and Ella delivered to her door one summer night. When the children
arrived and no Sethe, she was afraid and grateful. Grateful that the part of the family that survived was her
own grandchildren—the first and only she would know: two boys and a little girl who was crawling
already. But she held her heart still, afraid to form questions: What about Sethe and Halle; why the delay?
Why didn’t Sethe get on board too? Nobody could make it alone. Not only because trappers picked them
off like buzzards or netted them like rabbits, but also because you couldn’t run if you didn’t know how to
go. You could be lost forever, if there wasn’t nobody to show you the way.
So when Sethe arrived—all mashed up and split open, but with another grandchild in her arms—the
idea of a whoop moved closer to the front of her brain. But since there was still no sign of Halle and Sethe
herself didn’t know what had happened to him, she let the whoop lie—not wishing to hurt his chances by
thanking God too soon.
It was Stamp Paid who started it. Twenty days after Sethe got to 124 he came by and looked at the
baby he had tied up in his nephew’s jacket, looked at the mother he had handed a piece of fried eel to and,
for some private reason of his own, went off with two buckets to a place near the river’s edge that only he
knew about where blackberries grew, tasting so good and happy that to eat them was like being in church.
Just one of the berries and you felt anointed. He walked six miles to the riverbank; did a slide-run-slide
down into a ravine made almost inaccessible by brush. He reached through brambles lined with blooddrawing thorns thick as knives that cut through his shirt sleeves and trousers. All the while suffering
mosquitoes, bees, hornets, wasps and the meanest lady spiders in the state. Scratched, raked and bitten, he
maneuvered through and took hold of each berry with fingertips so gentle not a single one was bruised.
Late in the afternoon he got back to 124 and put two full buckets down on the porch. When Baby Suggs
saw his shredded clothes, bleeding hands, welted face and neck she sat down laughing out loud.
Buglar, Howard, the woman in the bonnet and Sethe came to look and then laughed along with Baby
Suggs at the sight of the sly, steely old black man: agent, fisherman, boatman, tracker, savior, spy,
standing in broad daylight whipped finally by two pails of blackberries. Paying them no mind he took a
berry and put it in the three-week-old Denver’s mouth. The women shrieked.
“She’s too little for that, Stamp.”
“Bowels be soup.”
“Sickify her stomach.”
But the baby’s thrilled eyes and smacking lips made them follow suit, sampling one at a time the
berries that tasted like church. Finally Baby Suggs slapped the boys’ hands away from the bucket and sent
Stamp around to the pump to rinse himself. She had decided to do something with the fruit worthy of the
man’s labor and his love. That’s how it began.
She made the pastry dough and thought she ought to tell Ella and John to stop on by because three
pies, maybe four, were too much to keep for one’s own. Sethe thought they might as well back it up with a
couple of chickens. Stamp allowed that perch and catfish were jumping into the boat—didn’t even have to
drop a line.
From Denver’s two thrilled eyes it grew to a feast for ninety people. 124 shook with their voices far
into the night. Ninety people who ate so well, and laughed so much, it made them angry. They woke up
the next morning and remembered the meal-fried perch that Stamp Paid handled with a hickory twig,
holding his left palm out against the spit and pop of the boiling grease; the corn pudding made with cream;
tired, overfed children asleep in the grass, tiny bones of roasted rabbit still in their hands—and got angry.
Baby Suggs’ three (maybe four) pies grew to ten (maybe twelve). Sethe’s two hens became five
turkeys. The one block of ice brought all the way from Cincinnati—over which they poured mashed
watermelon mixed with sugar and mint to make a punch—became a wagonload of ice cakes for a washtub
full of strawberry shrug. 124, rocking with laughter, goodwill and food for ninety, made them angry. Too
much, they thought. Where does she get it all, Baby Suggs, holy? Why is she and hers always the center of
things? How come she always knows exactly what to do and when? Giving advice; passing messages;
healing the sick, hiding fugitives, loving, cooking, cooking, loving, preaching, singing, dancing and loving
everybody like it was her job and hers alone.
Now to take two buckets of blackberries and make ten, maybe twelve, pies; to have turkey enough for
the whole town pretty near, new peas in September, fresh cream but no cow, ice and sugar, batter bread,
bread pudding, raised bread, shortbread—it made them mad. Loaves and fishes were His powers—they
did not belong to an exslave who had probably never carried one hundred pounds to the scale, or picked
okra with a baby on her back. Who had never been lashed by a ten-year-old whiteboy as God knows they
had. Who had not even escaped slavery—had, in fact, been bought out of it by a doting son and driven to
the Ohio River in a wagon—free papers folded between her breasts (driven by the very man who had been
her master, who also paid her resettlement fee—name of Garner), and rented a house with two floors and a
well from the Bodwins—the white brother and sister who gave Stamp Paid, Ella and John clothes, goods
and gear for runaways because they hated slavery worse than they hated slaves.
It made them furious. They swallowed baking soda, the morning after, to calm the stomach violence
caused by the bounty, the reckless generosity on display at 124. Whispered to each other in the yards
about fat rats, doom and uncalled-for pride.
The scent of their disapproval lay heavy in the air. Baby Suggs woke to it and wondered what it was as
she boiled hominy for her grandchildren. Later, as she stood in the garden, chopping at the tight soil over
the roots of the pepper plants, she smelled it again. She lifted her head and looked around. Behind her
some yards to the left Sethe squatted in the pole beans. Her shoulders were distorted by the greased flannel
under her dress to encourage the healing of her back. Near her in a bushel basket was the three-week-old
baby. Baby Suggs, holy, looked up. The sky was blue and clear. Not one touch of death in the definite
green of the leaves. She could hear birds and, faintly, the stream way down in the meadow. The puppy,
Here Boy, was burying the last bones from yesterday’s party. From somewhere at the side of the house
came the voices of Buglar, Howard and the crawling girl. Nothing seemed amiss—yet the smell of
disapproval was sharp. Back beyond the vegetable garden, closer to the stream but in full sun, she had
planted corn. Much as they’d picked for the party, there were still ears ripening, which she could see from
where she stood. Baby Suggs leaned back into the peppers and the squash vines with her hoe. Carefully,
with the blade at just the right angle, she cut through a stalk of insistent rue. Its flowers she stuck through
a split in her hat; the rest she tossed aside. The quiet clok clok clok of wood splitting reminded her that
Stamp was doing the chore he promised to the night before. She sighed at her work and, a moment later,
straightened up to sniff the disapproval once again. Resting on the handle of the hoe, she concentrated.
She was accustomed to the knowledge that nobody prayed for her—but this free-floating repulsion was
new. It wasn’t whitefolks—that much she could tell—so it must be colored ones. And then she knew. Her
friends and neighbors were angry at her because she had overstepped, given too much, offended them by
excess.
Baby closed her eyes. Perhaps they were right. Suddenly, behind the disapproving odor, way way back
behind it, she smelled another thing. Dark and coming. Something she couldn’t get at because the other
odor hid it.
She squeezed her eyes tight to see what it was but all she could make out was high-topped shoes she
didn’t like the look of.
Thwarted yet wondering, she chopped away with the hoe. What could it be? This dark and coming
thing. What was left to hurt her now? News of Halle’s death? No. She had been prepared for that better
than she had for his life. The last of her children, whom she barely glanced at when he was born because it
wasn’t worth the trouble to try to learn features you would never see change into adulthood anyway.
Seven times she had done that: held a little foot; examined the fat fingertips with her own—fingers she
never saw become the male or female hands a mother would recognize anywhere. She didn’t know to this
day what their permanent teeth looked like; or how they held their heads when they walked. Did Patty lose
her lisp? What color did Famous’ skin finally take? Was that a cleft in Johnny’s chin or just a dimple that
would disappear soon’s his jawbone changed? Four girls, and the last time she saw them there was no hair
under their arms. Does Ardelia still love the burned bottom of bread? All seven were gone or dead. What
would be the point of looking too hard at that youngest one? But for some reason they let her keep him.
He was with her—everywhere.
When she hurt her hip in Carolina she was a real bargain (costing less than Halle, who was ten then)
for Mr. Garner, who took them both to Kentucky to a farm he called Sweet Home. Because of the hip she
jerked like a three-legged dog when she walked. But at Sweet Home there wasn’t a rice field or tobacco
patch in sight, and nobody, but nobody, knocked her down. Not once. Lillian Garner called her Jenny for
some reason but she never pushed, hit or called her mean names. Even when she slipped in cow dung and
broke every egg in her apron, nobody said you-black-bitch, what’s-the-matter-with-you and nobody
knocked her down.
Sweet Home was tiny compared to the places she had been. Mr. Garner, Mrs. Garner, herself, Halle,
and four boys, over half named Paul, made up the entire population. Mrs. Garner hummed when she
worked; Mr. Garner acted like the world was a toy he was supposed to have fun with. Neither wanted her
in the field—Mr. Garner’s boys, including Halle, did all of that—which was a blessing since she could not
have managed it anyway. What she did was stand beside the humming Lillian Garner while the two of
them cooked, preserved, washed, ironed, made candles, clothes, soap and cider; fed chickens, pigs, dogs
and geese; milked cows, churned butter, rendered fat, laid fires…Nothing to it. And nobody knocked her
down.
Her hip hurt every single day—but she never spoke of it. Only Halle, who had watched her
movements closely for the last four years, knew that to get in and out of bed she had to lift her thigh with
both hands, which was why he spoke to Mr. Garner about buying her out of there so she could sit down
for a change. Sweet boy. The one person who did something hard for her: gave her his work, his life and
now his children, whose voices she could just make out as she stood in the garden wondering what was
the dark and coming thing behind the scent of disapproval. Sweet Home was a marked improvement. No
question. And no matter, for the sadness was at her center, the desolated center where the self that was no
self made its home. Sad as it was that she did not know where her children were buried or what they
looked like if alive, fact was she knew more about them than she knew about herself, having never had the
map to discover what she was like.
Could she sing? (Was it nice to hear when she did?) Was she pretty? Was she a good friend? Could
she have been a loving mother? A faithful wife? Have I got a sister and does she favor me? If my mother
knew me would she like me?
In Lillian Garner’s house, exempted from the field work that broke her hip and the exhaustion that
drugged her mind; in Lillian Garner’s house where nobody knocked her down (or up), she listened to the
whitewoman humming at her work; watched her face light up when Mr. Garner came in and thought, It’s
better here, but I’m not. The Garners, it seemed to her, ran a special kind of slavery, treating them like
paid labor, listening to what they said, teaching what they wanted known. And he didn’t stud his boys.
Never brought them to her cabin with directions to “lay down with her,” like they did in Carolina, or
rented their sex out on other farms. It surprised and pleased her, but worried her too. Would he pick
women for them or what did he think was going to happen when those boys ran smack into their nature?
Some danger he was courting and he surely knew it. In fact, his order for them not to leave Sweet Home,
except in his company, was not so much because of the law, but the danger of men-bred slaves on the
loose.
Baby Suggs talked as little as she could get away with because what was there to say that the roots of
her tongue could manage? So the whitewoman, finding her new slave excellent if silent help, hummed to
herself while she worked.
When Mr. Garner agreed to the arrangements with Halle, and when Halle looked like it meant more to
him that she go free than anything in the world, she let herself be taken ’cross the river. Of the two hard
things—standing on her feet till she dropped or leaving her last and probably only living child—she chose
the hard thing that made him happy, and never put to him the question she put to herself: What for? What
does a sixty-odd-year-old slavewoman who walks like a three-legged dog need freedom for? And when
she stepped foot on free ground she could not believe that Halle knew what she didn’t; that Halle, who had
never drawn one free breath, knew that there was nothing like it in this world. It scared her.
Something’s the matter. What’s the matter? What’s the matter? she asked herself. She didn’t know
what she looked like and was not curious. But suddenly she saw her hands and thought with a clarity as
simple as it was dazzling, “These hands belong to me. These my hands.” Next she felt a knocking in her
chest and discovered something else new: her own heartbeat. Had it been there all along? This pounding
thing? She felt like a fool and began to laugh out loud. Mr. Garner looked over his shoulder at her with
wide brown eyes and smiled himself. “What’s funny, Jenny?”
She couldn’t stop laughing. “My heart’s beating,” she said.
And it was true.
M. Garner laughed. “Nothing to be scared of, Jenny. Just keep your same ways, you’ll be all right.”
She covered her mouth to keep from laughing too loud.
“These people I’m taking you to will give you what help you need. Name of Bodwin. A brother and a
sister. Scots. I been knowing them for twenty years or more.“
Baby Suggs thought it was a good time to ask him something she had long wanted to know.
“Mr. Garner,” she said, “why you all call me Jenny?”
“’Cause that what’s on your sales ticket, gal. Ain’t that your name? What you call yourself?”
“Nothing,” she said. “I don’t call myself nothing.”
Mr. Garner went red with laughter. “When I took you out of Carolina, Whitlow called you Jenny and
Jenny Whitlow is what his bill said. Didn’t he call you Jenny?”
“No, sir. If he did I didn’t hear it.”
“What did you answer to?”
“Anything, but Suggs is what my husband name.”
“You got married, Jenny? I didn’t know it.”
“Manner of speaking.”
“You know where he is, this husband?”
“No, sir.”
“Is that Halle’s daddy?”
“No, sir.”
“Why you call him Suggs, then? His bill of sale says Whitlow too, just like yours.”
“Suggs is my name, sir. From my husband. He didn’t call me Jenny.”
“What he call you?”
“Baby.”
“Well,” said Mr. Garner, going pink again, “if I was you I’d stick to Jenny Whitlow. Mrs. Baby Suggs
ain’t no name for a freed Negro.”
Maybe not, she thought, but Baby Suggs was all she had left of the “husband” she claimed. A serious,
melancholy man who taught her how to make shoes. The two of them made a pact: whichever one got a
chance to run would take it; together if possible, alone if not, and no looking back. He got his chance, and
since she never heard otherwise she believed he made it. Now how could he find or hear tell of her if she
was calling herself some bill-of-sale name?
She couldn’t get over the city. More people than Carolina and enough whitefolks to stop the breath.
Two-story buildings everywhere, and walkways made of perfectly cut slats of wood. Roads wide as
Garner’s whole house.
“This is a city of water,” said Mr. Garner. “Everything travels by water and what the rivers can’t carry
the canals take. A queen of a city, Jenny. Everything you ever dreamed of, they make it right here. Iron
stoves, buttons, ships, shirts, hairbrushes, paint, steam engines, books. A sewer system make your eyes
bug out. Oh, this is a city, all right. If you have to live in a city—this is it.”
The Bodwins lived right in the center of a street full of houses and trees. Mr. Garner leaped out and
tied his horse to a solid iron post.
“Here we are.”
Baby picked up her bundle and with great difficulty, caused by her hip and the hours of sitting in a
wagon, climbed down. Mr. Garner was up the walk and on the porch before she touched ground, but she
got a peep at a Negro girl’s face at the open door before she followed a path to the back of the house. She
waited what seemed a long time before this same girl opened the kitchen door and offered her a seat by
the window.
“Can I get you anything to eat, ma’am?” the girl asked.
“No, darling. I’d look favorable on some water though.” The girl went to the sink and pumped a
cupful of water. She placed it in Baby Suggs’ hand. “I’m Janey, ma’am.”
Baby, marveling at the sink, drank every drop of water although it tasted like a serious medicine.
“Suggs,” she said, blotting her lips with the back of her hand. “Baby Suggs.”
“Glad to meet you, Mrs. Suggs. You going to be staying here?”
“I don’t know where I’ll be. Mr. Garner—that’s him what brought me here—he say he arrange
something for me.” And then, “I’m free, you know.”
Janey smiled. “Yes, ma’am.”
“Your people live around here?”
“Yes, ma’am. All us live out on Bluestone.”
“We scattered,” said Baby Suggs, “but maybe not for long.”
Great God, she thought, where do I start? Get somebody to write old Whitlow. See who took Patty and
Rosa Lee. Somebody name Dunn got Ardelia and went West, she heard. No point in trying for Tyree or
John. They cut thirty years ago and, if she searched too hard and they were hiding, finding them would do
them more harm than good. Nancy and Famous died in a ship off the Virginia coast before it set sail for
Savannah. That much she knew. The overseer at Whitlow’s place brought her the news, more from a wish
to have his way with her than from the kindness of his heart. The captain waited three weeks in port, to get
a full cargo before setting off. Of the slaves in the hold who didn’t make it, he said, two were Whitlow
pickaninnies name of…
But she knew their names. She knew, and covered her ears with her fists to keep from hearing them
come from his mouth.
Janey heated some milk and poured it in a bowl next to a plate of cornbread. After some coaxing,
Baby Suggs came to the table and sat down. She crumbled the bread into the hot milk and discovered she
was hungrier than she had ever been in her life and that was saying something.
“They going to miss this?”
“No,” said Janey. “Eat all you want; it’s ours.”
“Anybody else live here?”
“Just me. Mr. Woodruff, he does the outside chores. He comes by two, three days a week.”
“Just you two?”
“Yes, ma’am. I do the cooking and washing.”
“Maybe your people know of somebody looking for help.”
“I be sure to ask, but I know they take women at the slaughterhouse.”
“Doing what?”
“I don’t know.”
“Something men don’t want to do, I reckon.”
“My cousin say you get all the meat you want, plus twenty-five cents the hour. She make summer
sausage.”
Baby Suggs lifted her hand to the top of her head. Money? Money? They would pay her money every
single day? Money?
“Where is this here slaughterhouse?” she asked.
Before Janey could answer, the Bodwins came in to the kitchen with a grinning Mr. Garner behind.
Undeniably brother and sister, both dressed in gray with faces too young for their snow-white hair.
“Did you give her anything to eat, Janey?” asked the brother.
“Yes, sir.”
“Keep your seat, Jenny,” said the sister, and that good news got better.
When they asked what work she could do, instead of reeling off the hundreds of tasks she had
performed, she asked about the slaughterhouse. She was too old for that, they said.
“She’s the best cobbler you ever see,” said Mr. Garner.
“Cobbler?” Sister Bodwin raised her black thick eyebrows. “Who taught you that?”
“Was a slave taught me,” said Baby Suggs.
“New boots, or just repair?”
“New, old, anything.”
“Well,” said Brother Bodwin, “that’ll be something, but you’ll need more.”
“What about taking in wash?” asked Sister Bodwin.
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Two cents a pound.”
“Yes, ma’am. But where’s the in?”
“What?”
“You said ‘take in wash.’ Where is the ‘in’? Where I’m going to be.”
“Oh, just listen to this, Jenny,” said Mr. Garner. “These two angels got a house for you. Place they
own out a ways.”
It had belonged to their grandparents before they moved in town. Recently it had been rented out to a
whole parcel of Negroes, who had left the state. It was too big a house for Jenny alone, they said (two
rooms upstairs, two down), but it was the best and the only thing they could do. In return for laundry,
some seamstress work, a little canning and so on (oh shoes, too), they would permit her to stay there.
Provided she was clean. The past parcel of colored wasn’t Baby Suggs agreed to the situation, sorry to see
the money go but excited about a house with steps—never mind she couldn’t climb them. Mr. Garner told
the Bodwins that she was a right fine cook as well as a fine cobbler and showed his belly and the sample
on his feet. Everybody laughed.
“Anything you need, let us know,” said the sister. “We don’t hold with slavery, even Garner’s kind.”
“Tell em, Jenny. You live any better on any place before mine?”
“No, sir,” she said. “No place.”
“How long was you at Sweet Home?”
“Ten year, I believe.”
“Ever go hungry?”
“No, sir.”
“Cold?”
“No, sir.”
“Anybody lay a hand on you?”
“No, sir.”
“Did I let Halle buy you or not?”
“Yes, sir, you did,” she said, thinking, But you got my boy and I’m all broke down. You be renting
him out to pay for me way after I’m gone to Glory.
Woodruff, they said, would carry her out there, they said, and all three disappeared through the kitchen
door.
“I have to fix the supper now,” said Janey.
“I’ll help,” said Baby Suggs. “You too short to reach the fire.”
It was dark when Woodruff clicked the horse into a trot. He was a young man with a heavy beard and
a burned place on his jaw the beard did not hide.
“You born up here?” Baby Suggs asked him.
“No, ma’am. Virginia. Been here a couple years.”
“I see.”
“You going to a nice house. Big too. A preacher and his family was in there. Eighteen children.”
“Have mercy. Where they go?”
“Took off to Illinois. Bishop Allen gave him a congregation up there. Big.”
“What churches around here? I ain’t set foot in one in ten years.”
“How come?”
“Wasn’t none. I dislike the place I was before this last one, but I did get to church every Sunday some
kind of way. I bet the Lord done forgot who I am by now.”
“Go see Reverend Pike, ma’am. He’ll reacquaint you.”
“I won’t need him for that. I can make my own acquaintance. What I need him for is to reacquaint me
with my children. He can read and write, I reckon?”
“Sure.”
“Good, ’cause I got a lot of digging up to do.” But the news they dug up was so pitiful she quit. After
two years of messages written by the preacher’s hand, two years of washing, sewing, canning, cobbling,
gardening, and sitting in churches, all she found out was that the Whitlow place was gone and that you
couldn’t write to “a man named Dunn” if all you knew was that he went West. The good news, however,
was that Halle got married and had a baby coming. She fixed on that and her own brand of preaching,
having made up her mind about what to do with the heart that started beating the minute she crossed the
Ohio River. And it worked out, worked out just fine, until she got proud and let herself be overwhelmed
by the sight of her daughter-in-law and Halle’s children—one of whom was born on the way—and have a
celebration of blackberries that put Christmas to shame. Now she stood in the garden smelling
disapproval, feeling a dark and coming thing, and seeing high-topped shoes that she didn’t like the look of
at all. At all.
WHEN THE four horsemen came—schoolteacher, one nephew, one slave catcher and a sheriff—the
house on Bluestone Road was so quiet they thought they were too late. Three of them dismounted, one
stayed in the saddle, his rifle ready, his eyes trained away from the house to the left and to the right,
because likely as not the fugitive would make a dash for it. Although sometimes, you could never tell,
you’d find them folded up tight somewhere: beneath floorboards, in a pantry—once in a chimney. Even
then care was taken, because the quietest ones, the ones you pulled from a press, a hayloft, or, that once,
from a chimney, would go along nicely for two or three seconds. Caught red-handed, so to speak, they
would seem to recognize the futility of outsmarting a whiteman and the hopelessness of outrunning a rifle.
Smile even, like a child caught dead with his hand in the jelly jar, and when you reached for the rope to tie
him, well, even then you couldn’t tell. The very nigger with his head hanging and a little jelly-jar smile on
his face could all of a sudden roar, like a bull or some such, and commence to do disbelievable things.
Grab the rifle at its mouth; throw himself at the one holding it—anything. So you had to keep back a pace,
leave the tying to another. Otherwise you ended up killing what you were paid to bring back alive. Unlike
a snake or a bear, a dead nigger could not be skinned for profit and was not worth his own dead weight in
coin.
Six or seven Negroes were walking up the road toward the house: two boys from the slave catcher’s
left and some women from his right. He motioned them still with his rifle and they stood where they were.
The nephew came back from peeping inside the house, and after touching his lips for silence, pointed his
thumb to say that what they were looking for was round back. The slave catcher dismounted then and
joined the others. Schoolteacher and the nephew moved to the left of the house; himself and the sheriff to
the right. A crazy old nigger was standing in the woodpile with an ax. You could tell he was crazy right
off because he was grunting—making low, cat noises like. About twelve yards beyond that nigger was
another one—a woman with a flower in her hat. Crazy too, probably, because she too was standing stockstill—but fanning her hands as though pushing cobwebs out of her way. Both, however, were staring at
the same place—a shed. Nephew walked over to the old nigger boy and took the ax from him. Then all
four started toward the shed.
Inside, two boys bled in the sawdust and dirt at the feet of a nigger woman holding a blood-soaked
child to her chest with one hand and an infant by the heels in the other. She did not look at them; she
simply swung the baby toward the wall planks, missed and tried to connect a second time, when out of
nowhere—in the ticking time the men spent staring at what there was to stare at—the old nigger boy, still
mewing, ran through the door behind them and snatched the baby from the arch of its mother’s swing.
Right off it was clear, to schoolteacher especially, that there was nothing there to claim. The three
(now four-because she’d had the one coming when she cut) pickaninnies they had hoped were alive and
well enough to take back to Kentucky, take back and raise properly to do the work Sweet Home
desperately needed, were not. Two were lying open-eyed in sawdust; a third pumped blood down the dress
of the main one—the woman schoolteacher bragged about, the one he said made fine ink, damn good
soup, pressed his collars the way he liked besides having at least ten breeding years left. But now she’d
gone wild, due to the mishandling of the nephew who’d overbeat her and made her cut and run.
Schoolteacher had chastised that nephew, telling him to think—just think—what would his own horse do
if you beat it beyond the point of education. Or Chipper, or Samson. Suppose you beat the hounds past
that point thataway. Never again could you trust them in the woods or anywhere else. You’d be feeding
them maybe, holding out a piece of rabbit in your hand, and the animal would revert—bite your hand
clean off. So he punished that nephew by not letting him come on the hunt. Made him stay there, feed
stock, feed himself, feed Lillian, tend crops. See how he liked it; see what happened when you overbeat
creatures God had given you the responsibility of—the trouble it was, and the loss. The whole lot was lost
now. Five. He could claim the baby struggling in the arms of the mewing old man, but who’d tend her?
Because the woman—something was wrong with her. She was looking at him now, and if his other
nephew could see that look he would learn the lesson for sure: you just can’t mishandle creatures and
expect success.
The nephew, the one who had nursed her while his brother held her down, didn’t know he was
shaking. His uncle had warned him against that kind of confusion, but the warning didn’t seem to be
taking. What she go and do that for? On account of a beating? Hell, he’d been beat a million times and he
was white. Once it hurt so bad and made him so mad he’d smashed the well bucket. Another time he took
it out on Samson—a few tossed rocks was all. But no beating ever made him…I mean no way he could
have…What she go and do that for? And that is what he asked the sheriff, who was standing there amazed
like the rest of them, but not shaking. He was swallowing hard, over and over again. “What she want to go
and do that for?”
The sheriff turned, then said to the other three, “You all better go on. look like your business is over.
Mine’s started now.”
Schoolteacher beat his hat against his thigh and spit before leaving the woodshed. Nephew and the
catcher backed out with him. They didn’t look at the woman in the pepper plants with the flower in her
hat. And they didn’t look at the seven or so faces that had edged closer in spite of the catcher’s rifle
warning. Enough nigger eyes for now. Little nigger-boy eyes open in sawdust; little nigger-girl eyes
staring between the wet fingers that held her face so her head wouldn’t fall off; little nigger-baby eyes
crinkling up to cry in the arms of the old nigger whose own eyes were nothing but slivers looking down at
his feet. But the worst ones were those of the nigger woman who looked like she didn’t have any. Since
the whites in them had disappeared and since they were as black as her skin, she looked blind.
They unhitched from schoolteacher’s horse the borrowed mule that was to carry the fugitive woman
back to where she belonged, and tied it to the fence. Then, with the sun straight up over their heads, they
trotted off, leaving the sheriff behind among the damnedest bunch of coons they’d ever seen. All
testimony to the results of a little so-called freedom imposed on people who needed every care and
guidance in the world to keep them from the cannibal life they preferred.
The sheriff wanted to back out too. To stand in the sunlight outside of that place meant for housing
wood, coal, kerosene—fuel for cold Ohio winters, which he thought of now, while resisting the urge to
run into the August sunlight. Not because he was afraid. Not at all. He was just cold. And he didn’t want
to touch anything. The baby in the old man’s arms was crying, and the woman’s eyes with no whites were
gazing straight ahead. They all might have remained that way, frozen till Thursday, except one of the boys
on the floor sighed. As if he were sunk in the pleasure of a deep sweet sleep, he sighed the sigh that flung
the sheriff into action.
“I’ll have to take you in. No trouble now. You’ve done enough to last you. Come on now.”
She did not move.
“You come quiet, hear, and I won’t have to tie you up.”
She stayed still and he had made up his mind to go near her and some kind of way bind her wet red
hands when a shadow behind him in the doorway made him turn. The nigger with the flower in her hat
entered.
Baby Suggs noticed who breathed and who did not and went straight to the boys lying in the dirt. The
old man moved to the woman gazing and said, “Sethe. You take my armload and gimme yours.”
She turned to him, and glancing at the baby he was holding, made a low sound in her throat as though
she’d made a mistake, left the salt out of the bread or something.
“I’m going out here and send for a wagon,” the sheriff said and got into the sunlight at last.
But neither Stamp Paid nor Baby Suggs could make her put her crawling-already? girl down. Out of
the shed, back in the house, she held on. Baby Suggs had got the boys inside and was bathing their heads,
rubbing their hands, lifting their lids, whispering, “Beg your pardon, I beg your pardon,” the whole time.
She bound their wounds and made them breathe camphor before turning her attention to Sethe. She took
the crying baby from Stamp Paid and carried it on her shoulder for a full two minutes, then stood in front
of its mother.
“It’s time to nurse your youngest,” she said.
Sethe reached up for the baby without letting the dead one go.
Baby Suggs shook her head. “One at a time,” she said and traded the living for the dead, which she
carried into the keeping room. When she came back, Sethe was aiming a bloody nipple into the baby’s
mouth. Baby Suggs slammed her fist on the table and shouted, “Clean up! Clean yourself up!”
They fought then. Like rivals over the heart of the loved, they fought. Each struggling for the nursing
child. Baby Suggs lost when she slipped in a red puddle and fell. So Denver took her mother’s milk right
along with the blood of her sister. And that’s the way they were when the sheriff returned, having
commandeered a neighbor’s cart, and ordered Stamp to drive it.
Outside a throng, now, of black faces stopped murmuring. Holding the living child, Sethe walked past
them in their silence and hers. She climbed into the cart, her profile knife-clean against a cheery blue sky.
A profile that shocked them with its clarity. Was her head a bit too high? Her back a little too straight?
Probably. Otherwise the singing would have begun at once, the moment she appeared in the doorway of
the house on Bluestone Road. Some cape of sound would have quickly been wrapped around her, like
arms to hold and steady her on the way. As it was, they waited till the cart turned about, headed west to
town. And then no words. Humming. No words at all.
Baby Suggs meant to run, skip down the porch steps after the cart, screaming, No. No. Don’t let her
take that last one too. She meant to. Had started to, but when she got up from the floor and reached the
yard the cart was gone and a wagon was rolling up. A red-haired boy and a yellow-haired girl jumped
down and ran through the crowd toward her. The boy had a half-eaten sweet pepper in one hand and a pair
of shoes in the other.
“Mama says Wednesday.” He held them together by their tongues. “She says you got to have these
fixed by Wednesday.”
Baby Suggs looked at him, and then at the woman holding a twitching lead horse to the road.
“She says Wednesday, you hear? Baby? Baby?”
She took the shoes from him—high-topped and muddy—saying, “I beg your pardon. Lord, I beg your
pardon. I sure do.”
Out of sight, the cart creaked on down Bluestone Road. Nobody in it spoke. The wagon rock had put
the baby to sleep. The hot sun dried Sethe’s dress, stiff, like rigor mortis.
THAT AIN’T her mouth.
Anybody who didn’t know her, or maybe somebody who just got a glimpse of her through the
peephole at the restaurant, might think it was hers, but Paul D knew better. Oh well, a little something
around the forehead—a quietness—that kind of reminded you of her. But there was no way you could take
that for her mouth and he said so. Told Stamp Paid, who was watching him carefully.
“I don’t know, man. Don’t look like it to me. I know Sethe’s mouth and this ain’t it.” He smoothed the
clipping with his fingers and peered at it, not at all disturbed. From the solemn air with which Stamp had
unfolded the paper, the tenderness in the old man’s fingers as he stroked its creases and flattened it out,
first on his knees, then on the split top of the piling, Paul D knew that it ought to mess him up. That
whatever was written on it should shake him.
Pigs were crying in the chute. All day Paul D, Stamp Paid and twenty more had pushed and prodded
them from canal to shore to chute to slaughterhouse. Although, as grain farmers moved west, St. Louis
and Chicago now ate up a lot of the business, Cincinnati was still pig port in the minds of Ohioans. Its
main job was to receive, slaughter and ship up the river the hogs that Northerners did not want to live
without. For a month or so in the winter any stray man had work, if he could breathe the stench of offal
and stand up for twelve hours, skills in which Paul D was admirably trained.
A little pig shit, rinsed from every place he could touch, remained on his boots, and he was conscious
of it as he stood there with a light smile of scorn curling his lips. Usually he left his boots in the shed and
put his walking shoes on along with his day clothes in the corner before he went home. A route that took
him smack dab through the middle of a cemetery as old as sky, rife with the agitation of dead Miami no
longer content to rest in the mounds that covered them. Over their heads walked a strange people; through
their earth pillows roads were cut; wells and houses nudged them out of eternal rest. Outraged more by
their folly in believing land was holy than by the disturbances of their peace, they growled on the banks of
Licking River, sighed in the trees on Catherine Street and rode the wind above the pig yards. Paul D heard
them but he stayed on because all in all it wasn’t a bad job, especially in winter when Cincinnati
reassumed its status of slaughter and riverboat capital. The craving for pork was growing into a mania in
every city in the country. Pig farmers were cashing in, provided they could raise enough and get them sold
farther and farther away. And the Germans who flooded southern Ohio brought and developed swine
cooking to its highest form. Pig boats jammed the Ohio River, and their captains’ hollering at one another
over the grunts of the stock was as common a water sound as that of the ducks flying over their heads.
Sheep, cows and fowl too floated up and down that river, and all a Negro had to do was show up and there
was work: poking, killing, cutting, skinning, case packing and saving offal.
A hundred yards from the crying pigs, the two men stood behind a shed on Western Row and it was
clear why Stamp had been eyeing Paul D this last week of work; why he paused when the evening shift
came on, to let Paul D’s movements catch up to his own. He had made up his mind to show him this piece
of paper—newspaper—with a picture drawing of a woman who favored Sethe except that was not her
mouth. Nothing like it.
Paul D slid the clipping out from under Stamp’s palm. The print meant nothing to him so he didn’t
even glance at it. He simply looked at the face, shaking his head no. No. At the mouth, you see. And no at
whatever it was those black scratches said, and no to whatever it was Stamp Paid wanted him to know.
Because there was no way in hell a black face could appear in a newspaper if the story was about
something anybody wanted to hear. A whip of fear broke through the heart chambers as soon as you saw a
Negro’s face in a paper, since the face was not there because the person had a healthy baby, or outran a
street mob. Nor was it there because the person had been killed, or maimed or caught or burned or jailed
or whipped or evicted or stomped or raped or cheated, since that could hardly qualify as news in a
newspaper. It would have to be something out of the ordinary—something whitepeople would find
interesting, truly different, worth a few minutes of teeth sucking if not gasps. And it must have been hard
to find news about Negroes worth the breath catch of a white citizen of Cincinnati.
So who was this woman with a mouth that was not Sethe’s, but whose eyes were almost as calm as
hers? Whose head was turned on her neck in the manner he loved so well it watered his eye to see it.
And he said so. “This ain’t her mouth. I know her mouth and this ain’t it.” Before Stamp Paid could
speak he said it and even while he spoke Paul D said it again. Oh, he heard all the old man was saying, but
the more he heard, the stranger the lips in the drawing became.
Stamp started with the party, the one Baby Suggs gave, but stopped and backed up a bit to tell about
the berries—where they were and what was in the earth that made them grow like that.
“They open to the sun, but not the birds, ’cause snakes down in there and the birds know it, so they
just grow—fat and sweet—with nobody to bother em ’cept me because don’t nobody go in that piece of
water but me and ain’t too many legs willing to glide down that bank to get them. Me neither. But I was
willing that day. Somehow or ’nother I was willing. And they whipped me, I’m telling you. Tore me up.
But I filled two buckets anyhow. And took em over to Baby Suggs’ house. It was on from then on. Such a
cooking you never see no more. We baked, fried and stewed everything God put down here. Everybody
came. Everybody stuffed. Cooked so much there wasn’t a stick of kindlin left for the next day. I
volunteered to do it. And next morning I come over, like I promised, to do it.”
“But this ain’t her mouth,” Paul D said. “This ain’t it at all.”
Stamp Paid looked at him. He was going to tell him about how restless Baby Suggs was that morning,
how she had a listening way about her; how she kept looking down past the corn to the stream so much he
looked too. In between ax swings, he watched where Baby was watching. Which is why they both missed
it: they were looking the wrong way—toward water—and all the while it was coming down the road.
Four. Riding close together, bunched-up like, and righteous. He was going to tell him that, because he
thought it was important: why he and Baby Suggs both missed it. And about the party too, because that
explained why nobody ran on ahead; why nobody sent a fleet-footed son to cut ’cross a field soon as they
saw the four horses in town hitched for watering while the riders asked questions. Not Ella, not John, not
anybody ran down or to Bluestone Road, to say some new whitefolks with the Look just rode in. The
righteous Look every Negro learned to recognize along with his ma’am’s tit. Like a flag hoisted, this
righteousness telegraphed and announced the faggot, the whip, the fist, the lie, long before it went public.
Nobody warned them, and he’d always believed it wasn’t the exhaustion from a long day’s gorging that
dulled them, but some other thing—like, well, like meanness—that let them stand aside, or not pay
attention, or tell themselves somebody else was probably bearing the news already to the house on
Bluestone Road where a pretty woman had been living for almost a month. Young and deft with four
children one of which she delivered herself the day before she got there and who now had the full benefit
of Baby Suggs’ bounty and her big old heart. Maybe they just wanted to know if Baby really was special,
blessed in some way they were not. He was going to tell him that, but Paul D was laughing, saying, “Uh
uh. No way. A little semblance round the forehead maybe, but this ain’t her mouth.”
So Stamp Paid did not tell him how she flew, snatching up her children like a hawk on the wing; how
her face beaked, how her hands worked like claws, how she collected them every which way: one on her
shoulder, one under her arm, one by the hand, the other shouted forward into the woodshed filled with just
sunlight and shavings now because there wasn’t any wood. The party had used it all, which is why he was
chopping some. Nothing was in that shed, he knew, having been there early that morning. Nothing but
sunlight. Sunlight, shavings, a shovel. The ax he himself took out. Nothing else was in there except the
shovel—and of course the saw.
“You forgetting I knew her before,” Paul D was saying. “Back in Kentucky. When she was a girl. I
didn’t just make her acquaintance a few months ago. I been knowing her a long time. And I can tell you
for sure: this ain’t her mouth. May look like it, but it ain’t.”
So Stamp Paid didn’t say it all. Instead he took a breath and leaned toward the mouth that was not hers
and slowly read out the words Paul D couldn’t. And when he finished, Paul D said with a vigor fresher
than the first time, “I’m sorry, Stamp. It’s a mistake somewhere ’cause that ain’t her mouth.”
Stamp looked into Paul D’s eyes and the sweet conviction in them almost made him wonder if it had
happened at all, eighteen years ago, that while he and Baby Suggs were looking the wrong way, a pretty
little slavegirl had recognized a hat, and split to the woodshed to kill her children.
“SHE WAS crawling already when I got here. One week, less, and the baby who was sitting up and
turning over when I put her on the wagon was crawling already. Devil of a time keeping her off the stairs.
Nowadays babies get up and walk soon’s you drop em, but twenty years ago when I was a girl, babies
stayed babies longer. Howard didn’t pick up his own head till he was nine months. Baby Suggs said it was
the food, you know. If you ain’t got nothing but milk to give em, well they don’t do things so quick. Milk
was all I ever had. I thought teeth meant they was ready to chew. Wasn’t nobody to ask. Mrs. Garner
never had no children and we was the only women there.”
She was spinning. Round and round the room. Past the jelly cupboard, past the window, past the front
door, another window, the sideboard, the keeping-room door, the dry sink, the stove—back to the jelly
cupboard. Paul D sat at the table watching her drift into view then disappear behind his back, turning like
a slow but steady wheel. Sometimes she crossed her hands behind her back. Other times she held her ears,
covered her mouth or folded her arms across her breasts. Once in a while she rubbed her hips as she
turned, but the wheel never stopped.
“Remember Aunt Phyllis? From out by Minnowville? Mr. Garner sent one a you all to get her for each
and every one of my babies. That’d be the only time I saw her. Many’s the time I wanted to get over to
where she was. Just to talk. My plan was to ask Mrs. Garner to let me off at Minnowville whilst she went
to meeting. Pick me up on her way back. I believe she would a done that if I was to ask her. I never did,
’cause that’s the only day Halle and me had with sunlight in it for the both of us to see each other by. So
there wasn’t nobody. To talk to, I mean, who’d know when it was time to chew up a little something and
give it to em. Is that what make the teeth come on out, or should you wait till the teeth came and then solid
food? Well, I know now, because Baby Suggs fed her right, and a week later, when I got here she was
crawling already. No stopping her either. She loved those steps so much we painted them so she could see
her way to the top.”
Sethe smiled then, at the memory of it. The smile broke in two and became a sudden suck of air, but
she did not shudder or close her eyes. She wheeled.
“I wish I’d a known more, but, like I say, there wasn’t nobody to talk to. Woman, I mean. So I tried to
recollect what I’d seen back where I was before Sweet Home. How the women did there. Oh they knew all
about it. How to make that thing you use to hang the babies in the trees—so you could see them out of
harm’s way while you worked the fields. Was a leaf thing too they gave em to chew on. Mint, I believe, or
sassafras. Comfrey, maybe. I still don’t know how they constructed that basket thing, but I didn’t need it
anyway, because all my work was in the barn and the house, but I forgot what the leaf was. I could have
used that. I tied Buglar when we had all that pork to smoke. Fire everywhere and he was getting into
everything. I liked to lost him so many times. Once he got up on the well, right on it. I flew. Snatched him
just in time. So when I knew we’d be rendering and smoking and I couldn’t see after him, well, I got a
rope and tied it round his ankle. Just long enough to play round a little, but not long enough to reach the
well or the fire. I didn’t like the look of it, but I didn’t know what else to do. It’s hard, you know what I
mean? by yourself and no woman to help you get through. Halle was good, but he was debt-working all
over the place. And when he did get down to a little sleep, I didn’t want to be bothering him with all that.
Sixo was the biggest help. I don’t ’spect you rememory this, but Howard got in the milk parlor and Red
Cora I believe it was mashed his hand. Turned his thumb backwards. When I got to him, she was getting
ready to bite it. I don’t know to this day how I got him out. Sixo heard him screaming and come running.
Know what he did? Turned the thumb right back and tied it cross his palm to his little finger. See, I never
would have thought of that. Never. Taught me a lot, Sixo.”
It made him dizzy. At first he thought it was her spinning. Circling him the way she was circling the
subject. Round and round, never changing direction, which might have helped his head. Then he thought,
No, it’s the sound of her voice; it’s too near. Each turn she made was at least three yards from where he
sat, but listening to her was like having a child whisper into your ear so close you could feel its lips form
the words you couldn’t make out because they were too close. He caught only pieces of what she said—
which was fine, because she hadn’t gotten to the main part—the answer to the question he had not asked
outright, but which lay in the clipping he showed her. And lay in the smile as well. Because he smiled too,
when he showed it to her, so when she burst out laughing at the joke—the mix-up of her face put where
some other coloredwoman’s ought to be—well, he’d be ready to laugh right along with her. “Can you beat
it?” he would ask. And “Stamp done lost his mind,” she would giggle. “Plumb lost it.”
But his smile never got a chance to grow. It hung there, small and alone, while she examined the
clipping and then handed it back.
Perhaps it was the smile, or maybe the ever-ready love she saw in his eyes—easy and upfront, the way
colts, evangelists and children look at you: with love you don’t have to deserve—that made her go ahead
and tell him what she had not told Baby Suggs, the only person she felt obliged to explain anything to.
Otherwise she would have said what the newspaper said she said and no more. Sethe could recognize only
seventy-five printed words (half of which appeared in the newspaper clipping), but she knew that the
words she did not understand hadn’t any more power than she had to explain. It was the smile and the
upfront love that made her try.
“I don’t have to tell you about Sweet Home—what it was—but maybe you don’t know what it was
like for me to get away from there.”
Covering the lower half of her face with her palms, she paused to consider again the size of the
miracle; its flavor.
“I did it. I got us all out. Without Halle too. Up till then it was the only thing I ever did on my own.
Decided. And it came off right, like it was supposed to. We was here. Each and every one of my babies
and me too. I birthed them and I got em out and it wasn’t no accident. I did that. I had help, of course, lots
of that, but still it was me doing it; me saying, Go on, and Now. Me having to look out. Me using my own
head. But it was more than that. It was a kind of selfishness I never knew nothing about before. It felt
good. Good and right. I was big, Paul D, and deep and wide and when I stretched out my arms all my
children could get in between. I was that wide. Look like I loved em more after I got here. Or maybe I
couldn’t love em proper in Kentucky because they wasn’t mine to love. But when I got here, when I
jumped down off that wagon—there wasn’t nobody in the world I couldn’t love if I wanted to. You know
what I mean?”
Paul D did not answer because she didn’t expect or want him to, but he did know what she meant.
Listening to the doves in Alfred, Georgia, and having neither the right nor the permission to enjoy it
because in that place mist, doves, sunlight, copper dirt, moon—everything belonged to the men who had
the guns. Little men, some of them, big men too, each one of whom he could snap like a twig if he wanted
to. Men who knew their manhood lay in their guns and were not even embarrassed by the knowledge that
without gunshot fox would laugh at them. And these “men” who made even vixen laugh could, if you let
them, stop you from hearing doves or loving moonlight. So you protected yourself and loved small.
Picked the tiniest stars out of the sky to own; lay down with head twisted in order to see the loved one
over the rim of the trench before you slept. Stole shy glances at her between the trees at chain-up. Grass
blades, salamanders, spiders, woodpeckers, beetles, a kingdom of ants. Anything bigger wouldn’t do. A
woman, a child, a brother—a big love like that would split you wide open in Alfred, Georgia. He knew
exactly what she meant: to get to a place where you could love anything you chose—not to need
permission for desire—well now, that was freedom.
Circling, circling, now she was gnawing something else instead of getting to the point.
“There was this piece of goods Mrs. Garner gave me. Calico. Stripes it had with little flowers in
between. ’Bout a yard—not enough for more ’n a head tie. But I been wanting to make a shift for my girl
with it. Had the prettiest colors. I don’t even know what you call that color: a rose but with yellow in it.
For the longest time I been meaning to make it for her and do you know like a fool I left it behind? No
more than a yard, and I kept putting it off because I was tired or didn’t have the time. So when I got here,
even before they let me get out of bed, I stitched her a little something from a piece of cloth Baby Suggs
had. Well, all I’m saying is that’s a selfish pleasure I never had before. I couldn’t let all that go back to
where it was, and I couldn’t let her nor any of em live under schoolteacher. That was out.”
Sethe knew that the circle she was making around the room, him, the subject, would remain one. That
she could never close in, pin it down for anybody who had to ask. If they didn’t get it right off—she could
never explain. Because the truth was simple, not a long-drawn-out record of flowered shifts, tree cages,
selfishness, ankle ropes and wells. Simple: she was squatting in the garden and when she saw them
coming and recognized schoolteacher’s hat, she heard wings. Little hummingbirds stuck their needle
beaks right through her headcloth into her hair and beat their wings. And if she thought anything, it was
No. No. Nono. Nonono. Simple. She just flew. Collected every bit of life she had made, all the parts of her
that were precious and fine and beautiful, and carried, pushed, dragged them through the veil, out, away,
over there where no one could hurt them. Over there. Outside this place, where they would be safe. And
the hummingbird wings beat on. Sethe paused in her circle again and looked out the window. She
remembered when the yard had a fence with a gate that somebody was always latching and unlatching in
the time when 124 was busy as a way station. She did not see the whiteboys who pulled it down, yanked
up the posts and smashed the gate leaving 124 desolate and exposed at the very hour when everybody
stopped dropping by. The shoulder weeds of Bluestone Road were all that came toward the house.
When she got back from the jail house, she was glad the fence was gone. That’s where they had
hitched their horses—where she saw, floating above the railing as she squatted in the garden,
schoolteacher’s hat. By the time she faced him, looked him dead in the eye, she had something in her arms
that stopped him in his tracks. He took a backward step with each jump of the baby heart until finally there
were none.
“I stopped him,” she said, staring at the place where the fence used to be. “I took and put my babies
where they’d be safe.”
The roaring in Paul D’s head did not prevent him from hearing the pat she gave to the last word, and it
occurred to him that what she wanted for her children was exactly what was missing in 124: safety. Which
was the very first message he got the day he walked through the door. He thought he had made it safe, had
gotten rid of the danger; beat the shit out of it; run it off the place and showed it and everybody else the
difference between a mule and a plow. And because she had not done it before he got there her own self,
he thought it was because she could not do it. That she lived with 124 in helpless, apologetic resignation
because she had no choice; that minus husband, sons, mother-in-law, she and her slow-witted daughter
had to live there all alone making do. The prickly, mean-eyed Sweet Home girl he knew as Halle’s girl
was obedient (like Halle), shy (like Halle), and work-crazy (like Halle). He was wrong. This here Sethe
was new. The ghost in her house didn’t bother her for the very same reason a room-and-board witch with
new shoes was welcome. This here Sethe talked about love like any other woman; talked about baby
clothes like any other woman, but what she meant could cleave the bone. This here Sethe talked about
safety with a handsaw. This here new Sethe didn’t know where the world stopped and she began.
Suddenly he saw what Stamp Paid wanted him to see: more important than what Sethe had done was what
she claimed. It scared him.
“Your love is too thick,” he said, thinking, That bitch is looking at me; she is right over my head
looking down through the floor at me.
“Too thick?” she said, thinking of the Clearing where Baby Suggs’ commands knocked the pods off
horse chestnuts. “Love is or it ain’t. Thin love ain’t love at all.”
“Yeah. It didn’t work, did it? Did it work?” he asked.
“It worked,” she said.
“How? Your boys gone you don’t know where. One girl dead, the other won’t leave the yard. How did
it work?”
“They ain’t at Sweet Home. Schoolteacher ain’t got em.”
“Maybe there’s worse.”
“It ain’t my job to know what’s worse. It’s my job to know what is and to keep them away from what I
know is terrible. I did that.”
“What you did was wrong, Sethe.”
“I should have gone on back there? Taken my babies back there?”
“There could have been a way. Some other way.”
“What way?”
“You got two feet, Sethe, not four,” he said, and right then a forest sprang up between them; trackless
and quiet.
Later he
